1. Set this to ON to add the rtMedia menu to the WordPress Admin bar.
2. Enable this to use [JSON API](../developer/api/json-api/README.md) to handle API requests sent to rtMedia through any mobile application.
3. Keeping this ON helps the rtMedia team learn about the theme and plugins you are using. This allows the team to make rtMedia more compatible with your websites.

      **Note**: We do not collect, nor does the plugin transmit any private information about your site or infrastructure to us.

4. Setting this to ON will enable rtMedia to add a link in the footer section of the theme to the site. If you want to monetize the rtMedia footer link, you can add your affiliate-id in the text box. (Check our [rtMedia affiliate program](https://rtcamp.com/affiliates/))

Click **Save Settings** to save the settings.

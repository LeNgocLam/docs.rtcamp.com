# Settings

rtMedia has numerous options that give you absolute control over the way you want to display your media. To make it easy for the admin to tweak the settings,  we have separated them into different categories based on functionality.

To access the settings, click `rtMedia` > `Settings` from the admin dashboard of your site.

- [Display](display.md)
- [BuddyPress](buddypress.md)
- [Types](types.md)
- [Image Sizes](image-sizes.md)
- [Privacy](privacy.md)
- [Custom CSS](custom-css.md)
- [Other Settings](other-settings.md)

**Note**: These are settings for the free version of rtMedia plugin. For extended settings with rtMedia Pro add-ons refer to the [rtMedia Addons documentation](../../addons/rtmedia-pro/rtmedia-pro.md).

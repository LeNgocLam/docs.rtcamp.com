## Custom CSS

You can add in [custom CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/) code to style rtMedia, the way you want.

1. To add your own CSS styling, set **rtMedia default styles** to ON. If its OFF, the website style may break and you must need to add custom CSS in step 2.
2. Enter your custom CSS code.

   **Note**: Ensure that your CSS code is valid. rtMedia does not validate your code. Entering invalid CSS code can break your site.

The following is an example of CSS code. This hides the media title from the media galery.

```.rtmedia-list-item .rtmedia-item-title{ display: none; }```

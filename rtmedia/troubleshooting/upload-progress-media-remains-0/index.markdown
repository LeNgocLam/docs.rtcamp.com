title: Upload progress for media remains at 0%
---

Users of rtMedia prior to the 3.2 core version have often complained that media files do not get uploaded when they are selected.

It appears that the upload progress is stalled at 0%.


## The default behavior


Uploading of media should start after:



	
  1. Some text is added to be included in a BuddyPress activity update.

	
  2. The** Post Update** button in the uploader is clicked.

## Explanation


Media will get uploaded only after you post an activity update by clicking on the **Post Update** button.

Also note that this button is disabled if there is no activity text.

title: Migrating media from GD bbPress Attachments to rtMedia
---

_Note: This feature works with rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._

To import media from the GD bbPress Attachments plugin, go to **rtMedia** > **Support** > **Migration**.

The [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin should be installed so that thumbnails can be regenerated for older media to be used in rtMedia PRO.

### Description

When a subscriber attempts to modify an image, the page displays the text **-1** instead of the modification tools.

### Steps to Replicate

1. Log in as a **Subscriber**.
2. Navigate to a media gallery and click on an image uploaded by the subscriber to open it.
3. Click **Edit**, and then click **Modify** on the page that opens.

### Workaround:

Change default WordPress user role from **Subscriber** to **Contributor**. You may also need to change roles of previously registered users.

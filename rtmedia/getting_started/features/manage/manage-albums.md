* Albums can organize your media. Since rtMedia 3.0, you can create albums _without needing BuddyPress_.


* A lightbox appears to present a slideshow of media items in an album.


* You can move media between albums and merge albums.


* Global albums can be used to define preset albums. "Wall Posts" is an example of global album.

* Albums can be disabled if you do not wish to use them.



## Viewing Album Gallery


Click the **Media** tab of your BuddyPress profile, and then click **Albums** tab to view the **Album Gallery**. The **Album Gallery** lists all the albums that you have created. On another user's profile, the albums will be visible as per the privacy setting with which they were created: **public**, **friends** (BuddyPress friends) or **users** (logged in users).

If you use BuddyPress groups, the same media/album functions will be available there as well.

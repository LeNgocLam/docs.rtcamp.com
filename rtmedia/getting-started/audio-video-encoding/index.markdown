## Gold


This plan gives you 1TB of monthly bandwidth, and if it is exceeded, $0.08 will be charged per GB. The price is $99 per month.

Choose the plan that best meets your usage needs and click **Subscribe**. For **Silver**, **Gold** and **Platinum** plans, you will be redirected to rtCamp’s PayPal page.


## How does it work:


After you have chosen a plan, you will be sent a unique API key by email. Enter your API key in the **Enter API KEY** field, and click **Submit**. rtCamp will be able to keep track of your usage plan with the help of this key.

Note that the **Enter API Key** field is blank until an audio/video encoding plan is selected. In the screenshot above, the **Enter API KEY** field already contains a value because the Free plan has been chosen.

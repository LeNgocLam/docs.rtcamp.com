rtMedia has numerous options in its settings. To make it easy for the admin to navigate we have seperated them into different parts based on similarity.

(Note: These are settings for the free version of rtMedia Plugin. For extended settings with rtMedia Add-ons refer to [rtMedia Addons documentation](http://docs.rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/))




## Display

The **Display **tab will show you settings that relate to how the media on your website will be displayed.



	
  1. Switch on/off comments for any single media being viewed by the end-user.

	
  2. Switch on/off the option to "Use lightbox to display Media" for images. This means when the image is clicked by the end-user the lightbox effect will be used to display it. Also an admin can customize the number of media being displayed. The default value is "10".

	
  3. The Masonry Cascading grid layout can be enabled On or OFF. (Also read about Masonry Cascading Grid Feature)




## BuddyPress

  3. Admins can also enable or disable (On/Off) media for BuddyPress groups. This is by default switched OFF.

	
  4. Upload of media can also be allowed from status update box that shows up the activity stream with BuddyPress.

	
  5. With Bulk Uploads the activity stream can get flooded. The admin can limit the number of media files uploaded per activity. This will not affect the actual number of uploads. The default limit set is "0" which means unlimited.




## Types

The 3 types of media (image, video and music) displayed. Admins can easily set width and height of every type of media being displayed.



	
  1. Photo files that are shown available in three different pre-set sizes, mainly Thumbnail, Medium and Large. Admins can specify the size in pixels for every type of photo file. Admins can also choose to crop the image.
These pre-set sizes are used for different purposes as follow :
    Thumbnail : This image size is used to display list of media under media tab.
    Medium : This image size is used to display media in activity stream.
    Large : This image size is used for single media page or for light-box.

	
  2. Videos files being down in Activity or Single view can also be tweaked by Admins. They can specify the width and height of the video being displayed.

	
  3. Music files are also shown in both Activity or Single views. As this is a audio file, the only the width of the audio file played can be customized.

	
  4. Featured media files can also have custom height and width set by admins along with the option of cropping.

	
  5. When a video is uploaded a few thumbnails are created. Here admins can specify how many thumbnails should be created with every video upload.

## Overview


rtMedia is a comprehensive media plugin for WordPress, BuddyPress and bbPress. It helps users upload and organize media in the form of photos, audio and video.

rtMedia is free plugin and its settings and features can be extended with the help of [rtMedia PRO add-on](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/). A number of other premium add-ons are also available to enhance rtMedia’s central functions.

Do go through our checklist below before you start so you can make better and informed choices.

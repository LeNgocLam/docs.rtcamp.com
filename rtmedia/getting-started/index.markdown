## Overview


*rtMedia* is a comprehensive media plugin for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) and [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/). It helps users upload and organize media such as photos, audio clips and videos.

*rtMedia* is a free plugin and its settings and features can be extended with the help of the paid [rtMedia PRO add-on](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/). 

A number of other premium add-ons are also available to enhance *rtMediaâ€™s* central functions.

The following checklist can help you make an informed decision as to whether *rtMedia* is the right solution for your needs.


## Checklist

	
  * Do you use bbPress, and want your members to attach media to their forum or topic posts?

	
  * Do you run a niche community using BuddyPress, and want your members to post photos, audio clips and videos in activity updates?

	
  * Do you need to have media galleries associated with author profiles?

	
  * Do you want your users to be able to upload media from the front-end on your site for events, contests or any other reason?


If you answer **Yes** to any of these questions, then *rtMedia* is the best solution for your media needs.

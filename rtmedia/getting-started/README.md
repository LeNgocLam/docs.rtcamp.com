# Getting Started

The following checklist can help you make an informed decision as to whether rtMedia is the right solution for your needs.

## Checklist

  * Do you use bbPress, and want your members to attach media to their forum or topic posts?
  * Do you run a niche community using BuddyPress, and want your members to post photos, audio clips and videos in activity updates?
  * Do you need to have media galleries associated with author profiles?
  * Do you want your users to be able to upload media from the front-end on your site for events, contests or any other reason?

If you answer **Yes** to any of these questions, then rtMedia is the best solution for your media needs.

rtMedia is a free plugin and its settings and features can be extended with the help of the paid [premium add-ons](https://rtcamp.com/products/category/plugins/).

If you wish to upgrade our products with any newer version on your development sites, you may do it manully by downloading new updates from "my-accounts" section at URL [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/).


### What if I want to change domain name?


If you have already activated license on old domain, you can simply click **Deactivate** . Check the following screenshot:

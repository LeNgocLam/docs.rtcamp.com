Our premium themes and some WordPress plugins, for example rtMedia addons, may ask you for a license key.

The following are some common FAQs, followed by a troubleshooting guide.


## FAQ


You need to find the license key first in order to use it.


### Where Do I Find the Licence Key?


You can always find the license key in "my-accounts" section - URL: [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/)

Note that the above URL will ask for login details as it is accessible to registered users only.

If you do not remember the login details, do not panic. Reset your account password using the link - [https://rtcamp.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword](https://rtcamp.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword)

Use the same email address you have used at the time of purchase.

#### What If I Do Not Remember My Email Address That I Have Used at the Time of Purchase?


Search your emails for any order related email from rtcamp.com.

If you have used PayPal, try to find the PayPal transaction ID.

If you have used credit card directly, try to find any transaction related details.

When you find some information, email it to us at [support@rtcamp.com](mailto:support@rtcamp.com).

### What If I Do Not Activate My License?


Nothing will break. The license key is used only by the automated upgrade service.

You can download new updates from "my-accounts" section at URL [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/) and update your plugin manually like other plugins. Check the following screenshot for the download link:

### I Have a Development Environment. Do I Need to Buy Another License?


Absolutely no. Feel free to use our products on as many development and staging sites you need. Ignore license key notification.

No features are crippled by the absence of license key.

If you wish to upgrade our products with any newer version on your development sites, you may do it manually by downloading new updates from "my-accounts" section at URL [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/).


### What If I Want to Change Domain Name?


If you have already activated license on an old domain, you can simply click **Deactivate** . Check the following screenshot:

It may happen that the old domain was a temporary site and is already deleted. In that case, you may delete that site from  the "my-accounts" section at URL [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/).

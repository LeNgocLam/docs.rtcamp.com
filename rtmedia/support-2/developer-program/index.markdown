title: Request a Feature
---

Many of the requests on our support forum (& contact form) involve building or developing a custom feature within our existing plugin. Most common scenarios are as follows:

1. You are a developer who uses our plugin & happen to come up with brilliant feature to add to the plugin. Many times, such a feature is on our roadmap for the same plugin or as a premium add-on.

	
2. You are a Creative Agency with a client, whose website uses BuddyPress Media for community sharing. Now your client wants to add a specific feature within the already existing plugin (This happens a lot!).

	
3. You are or you will be a Venture Capitalist with faith in rtCamp & wants to support our "premium add-on" development.


Finding the  best solution which fits all 3 scenarios listed above was tough, so we came up with multiple options for you to choose:

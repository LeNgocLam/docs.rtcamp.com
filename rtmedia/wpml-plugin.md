This document is about how to configure and what steps are required to use rtMedia Plugin and WPML together.

rtMedia follows all the WordPress standards to translate strings and it is translation ready. However, there are many languages, and end users not that much tech savvy, hence the WPML translation is an easy way to translate all the strings with less efforts.

Test site of rtMedia and WMPL plugins setup together:

* English - http://theme-testing.wpml.org/plugin-rtmedia/activity/

* Spanish - http://theme-testing.wpml.org/plugin-rtmedia/es/activity/

To get started, you will need [WPML and add-on Plugins](http://wpml.org/purchase/).

The core WPML Multilingual plugin is always required along with String translations add-on.

Here you can find a [guide for installing & activating WPML](http://wpml.org/documentation/getting-started-guide/).

Also make sure you are using BuddyPress plugin in your website, you can read more about it here - [BuddyPress Multilingual plugin](https://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/buddypress-multilingual/).

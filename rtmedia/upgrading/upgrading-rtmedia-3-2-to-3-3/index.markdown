title: Upgrading from rtMedia 3.2.x to 3.3.x
---

This upgrade guide applies to you **only** if you have overridden [rtMedia template files](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/developer/templating-system/).


## Markup Changes


In rtMedia 3.3.x (3.2.13 to be exact), we made changes to the following template files:



	
  * media-single.php

	
  * media-single-edit.php

	
  * album-single-edit.php




## New Hooks Added


We also added new hooks in the following templates:


### Inside media-single.php


When single media is displayed in a lightbox:



	
  * rtmedia_action_buttons_after_media

	
  * rtmedia_actions_before_description

	
  * rtmedia_actions_before_comments


When single media is displayed without lightbox, on its own page:

	
  * rtmedia_actions_before_description

	
  * rtmedia_actions_without_lightbox




### Inside album-gallery.php





	
  * rtmedia_after_album_gallery_title




### Inside media-gallery.php





	
  * rtmedia_after_media_gallery_title


If you are using any template file from the above list in your theme, you may need to change template files to provide aÂ seamless rtMedia experience for your users.

###How it works:

2. Open uploaded media in lightbox or with URL, on mouse over you will see `Tag photo` section, click on it.

4. Once user tag other member to the photo, user will get a notification along with link of that media and time when its tagged.
5. Media author can tag itself to the media.
6. On mouse over, we can see who tagged to the photo.

### Troubleshooting

* When tagging a photo, the auto suggested name of member does not appear in text box.
* After clicking an auto suggested name, the member is not selected.

In both the above cases, there is a possibility that other WordPress plugins which you are using may be creating some issues with HTML, CSS or JavaScript Markup.

### Suggestion

* Deactivate all the plugins one by one (except BuddyPress, rtMedia and photo tagging), and check which plugin is causing the issue.
* Also, activate the default WordPress theme and check whether photo tagging is working or not.

## rtMedia Playlists for Audio

Audio can be grouped into playlists. Once the user upload any audio file, can create a playlist or use existing one to manage audio files.

This addon is useful to create playlist of all the uploaded audio files.

User can create their own playlist or use existing playlist created by website owner. It has privacy settings, so if someone uploaded a audio files of “best songs” and keep playlist “public” other users can use it.

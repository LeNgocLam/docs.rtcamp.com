## rtMedia Restrictions - Per User Upload Quota

Admins can set an upload limit on a time basis i.e Daily/Monthly/Lifetime. In addition, admins can set upload limits in terms of total size (MB) of all the media and total number of media a user can upload.

If a user exceeds any upload limit set by an admin, the appropriate error message will be shown before the user uploads any media. There are filters available to change the error message as per your choice.

**Allow User to Create Albums** : Enabling this setting allows users to create their own albums.
**Limit Number of Albums Per User** : This option allows the site administrator to limit the number of albums that every user can create. The default value is 0, which means that every user can create an unlimited number of albums.

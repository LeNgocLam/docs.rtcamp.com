## rtMedia Restrictions 

Site admin can set an upload limit on a time basis i.e Daily/Monthly/Lifetime. Also can set upload limits in terms of total size (MB) of all the media and total number of media a user can upload on website.

Along with media upload restriction, site admin can prevent site users to create new albums from their own. That way only pre-defined albums can be select when users upload media on site.

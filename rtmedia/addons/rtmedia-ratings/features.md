A new admin option - **Enable likes for media** - will be added along with rating admin setting, as shown.

Group members can like images, audio and video. In order to like Media, access it via the Media Tab in your group. However, you cannot see which user liked which media.

As media **Like** is part of rtMedia free version, admin may wish to keep ON either Like or rating. However, it is not compulsory to do so.

### Enable Sitewide Gallery Section


Enable this feature and then create a new album. Then, click the link marked **manage sitewide galleries from here**. Add files in the new album and click **Upload Now**. Note that only the site admin can create sitewide galleries. A sitewide gallery is one that can be viewed by all people who visit the website. This gallery is not part of a group.


### Slug for Sitewide Gallery Section


A slug is the part of a URL which identifies a page using human-readable keywords. It is usually the end part of the URL, which can be interpreted as the name of the resource. For example, in **http://www.example.com/services/legal/medical-patents**, the slug is **medical-patents**.

The following features are only available in rtMedia PRO:

### Enable for Non-Logged in Users Also 


This option allows anybody who can access your site to upload files using the comment form. This option is NOT recommended as it is a potential threat to users' privacy and site security.


### Display Attachments in Comments As


There are 2 display options:

* **With Thumbnail + file name** - Every media file will be displayed along with a thumbnail above its name

* **Without Thumbnail (only file name)** - Every media file will be displayed without a thumbnail above its name.

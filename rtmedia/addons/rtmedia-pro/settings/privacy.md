### Default Privacy


This option allows you to set the default privacy for all of the media that you have uploaded on your WordPress site. There are 4 options:


  * **Private**


  * **Friends**


  * **Logged In Users**


  * **Public**


The default option is **Private**.


### Allow Users to Set Privacy for their Content


This option allows users to define privacy for the content that they have uploaded. For group uploads, BuddyPress groups privacy is used, meaning that privacy applied in a group will be applied to all media uploads within that group.

_Note: This feature works in rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._

Users can attach files while creating a topic or reply in bbPress forums. Users can add photos, videos, music, documents and files in any format. For audio and video, rtMedia will take care of [format conversions](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/compare-encoding-solutions/) automatically if needed.

### Category


This column lists media categories, namely **Photo**, **Video**, **Music** and **Featured**.


### Entity


This column lists the entities into which each media type is classified.


### Width


Use this column to set the width of your media’s entity.


### Height


Use this column to set the height of your media’s entity.

Width and Height enable the site administrator to manually specify the width and height of each media type that can be uploaded in pixels. If you do not want to set limits on the width and height of a particular media item, simply enter 0 in the **Width** and **Height** fields.


### Crop


Select the check box against your media’s entity if you want to allow users to crop it. Enabling **Crop** for each media item will automatically crop it if exceeds the specified width and height.


### Number of thumbnails to generate on video upload


This option enables you to enter the number of thumbnails you want to generate after you upload a video. You can then select any one thumbnail from the list of generated thumbnails.

The default value is 2, which means that 2 thumbnails will be generated for every video that you upload. You can set any one thumbnail as the thumbnail for your uploaded video.

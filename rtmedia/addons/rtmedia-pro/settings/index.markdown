Most people who choose to get rtMedia -PRO add-on, want to do so for several additional settings and options it provides instead of the rtMedia Free version. This page will cover only the additional settings provided with rtMedia -PRO version. ([Check Documentation for rtMedia Core Settings](http://docs.rtcamp.com/rtmedia/getting-started/settings/))

In rtMedia (Free) version the settings tabs are displayed horizontally. But on rtMedia -PRO, because of the additional categories of features and to save space, the tabs are displayed vertically as seen in image below.

_Note: This feature works in rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._

An uploader may be available in the form of a sidebar widget, as highlighted in the screenshots below.

Website administrators may allow users to choose albums or privacy settings, based on which drop-down lists can be used.


### Uploading media


To upload a media item (photo, audio or video):



	
  1. If your site’s administrator has provided an option to choose an album for your media, select one using the provided drop-down list.

	
  2. If your site’s administrator has allowed setting the visibility for media, use the drop-down list provided to choose between the options **Private**, **Friends**, **Users**  and **Public**.

	
  3. Click on  **Select** to open a file dialog on your computer, and choose a media item.


The page then redirects to the uploaded media item’s page.

### Uploading media without album/privacy choice


If your administrator has not allowed users to choose an album or the privacy settings, the sidebar uploader widget will look like this:

The media that you upload will go to the album set by the administrator. Its visibility will also depend on the administrator’s choice.

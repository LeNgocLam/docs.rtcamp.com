## Moderation tools


In the rtMedia’s backend, moderation tools are provided to manage abuse.

Go to tab **rtMedia** > **Settings** > **Moderation**. Refer to the screenshot below.



	
  1. Moderation can be turned **ON** or **OFF** using a switch.

	
  2. The number of abuse reports after which content should be prevented from viewing by ordinary users can be set.  If this is set to 0, content will be automatically sent in for moderation, without users being able to view it.

  3. Administrator emails can be entered in the **Admin Emails** textarea, each separated by a comma. Emails will be sent to these admins whenever the **Report** button is clicked.

	
  4. The frequency of email notification can be set to **Daily**, **Hourly** or **Instant**.

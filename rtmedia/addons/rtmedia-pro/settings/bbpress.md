### Display Attachments in Topic Or Reply As


This option enables you to control the display of attachments when creating a topic or replying to a user in your site forums. There are 2 options:

* **With Thumbnail + file name**- Every media file will be displayed along with a thumbnail above its name.

* **Without Thumbnail (only file name)**- Every media file will be displayed without a thumbnail above its name.

### Enable Attachments in Topic or Reply


This  option allows users of bbPress forums to attach media and other file types to topics and replies. The screenshot below indicates how an attachment will appear in a forum topic or reply:

When the file dialog opens, press and hold down the keyboard’s *Ctrl* key while clicking on the files you want to attach. Click **Open**. Then click **Submit** on the topic or reply form on the forum. The maximum size of the uploaded file depends on the upload size limit set by the site administrator.

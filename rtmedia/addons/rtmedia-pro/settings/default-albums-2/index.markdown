Use this feature to set a global album as the default album for uploads across your site. All the albums that you have created will be displayed in a list as shown in the image above. 

You can either rename, delete or set any one of the albums as the default album. **Wall Posts** is preselected as the default album.

If you want to add a new album to the list, click **Add**.

Note that you cannot search for any media in the search bar, that is, you cannot access any media by entering its name in the search bar. You can only access media if you know the album in which it resides.

Similarly, you cannot search for albums, you have toÂ know the album name in order to access it.

  1. Turn moderation **ON** or **OFF**.

	2. Set the number of abuse reports after which content should be prevented from being viewed by ordinary users. Set this to **0** to send all content automatically for moderation, without users being able to view them.

  3. Enter the email addresses of Administrators in the **Admin Emails** text area, each separated by a comma. Emails will be sent to these admins whenever the **Report** button is clicked.

  4. Set the frequency of email notification to one of: **Daily**, **Hourly** or **Instant**.


### Managing Reported Media


Go to **rtMedia** > **Moderation** using the left navigation menu, to manage reported items.

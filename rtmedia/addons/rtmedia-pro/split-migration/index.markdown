---

rtMedia Pro has been split into 31 add-ons. To migrate rtMedia Pro in to these 31 add-ons, we will require your site's admin login details and server FTP/SSH login details.

You can create a premium support ticket from [here](https://rtcamp.com/premium-support/) if you want us to take care of migration. 

If you hesitate to provide your site's login credentials and want to do migration on your own, you can create premium support ticket and we will provie you a plugin (`rtmedia-pro-addon-split-migration.zip`) which will take care of migration.

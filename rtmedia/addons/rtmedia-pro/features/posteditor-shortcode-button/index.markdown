_Note: This feature works with rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can beÂ [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._

Using the rtMedia PRO add-on along with rtMedia's core, site administrators can quickly create gallery and uploader shortcodes by using the shortcode generator button in WordPress' post editor.

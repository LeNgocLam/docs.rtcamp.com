##  Post-Editor Shortcode Button


Using the rtMedia PRO add-on along with rtMedia’s core, site administrators can quickly create gallery and uploader shortcodes by using the shortcode generator button in WordPress’ post/page editor.

With this button, a UI appears to quickly generate shortcodes for special pages such as "Editorial Picks".

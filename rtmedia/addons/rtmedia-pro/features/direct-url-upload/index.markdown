title: Direct URL Upload

Users do not need to download media files from a URL and then upload it with rtMedia PRO. Just provide the URL for the media and rtMedia will handle it.


## Insert URL of the Media You Want to Upload

Below are the screenshots for how to upload photo and video via URL. Same goes for audio files as well.

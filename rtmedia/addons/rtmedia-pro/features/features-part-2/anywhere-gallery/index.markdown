rtMedia can help display media galleries anywhere on a WordPress site, listing media uploaded by users. Site administrators will use a gallery [shortcode](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/common/shortcodes/gallery-shortcode/) for this purpose.

If [rtMedia PRO](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/) is running on the site, documents and other files can also be listed along with regular media (images, audio and video).

Media or other files can be uploaded by users through an Anywhere uploader, [as explained here](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/user/rtmedia-wordpress/anywhere-uploader/). This is how a typical gallery will look like on on a page on your site: ![Media gallery on a WordPress page](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mediaGalleryWordPress.png) To view a slideshow of the album, click on any of the items in the gallery and simply use the keyboard's right and left arrow keys to look up every item. You can also use your mouse to click on the right and left arrow icons. If a gallery item opens in an individual page instead of as a slideshow, you will need to contact your site administrator to [enable the lightbox feature](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/admin/rtmedia-settings/general/).

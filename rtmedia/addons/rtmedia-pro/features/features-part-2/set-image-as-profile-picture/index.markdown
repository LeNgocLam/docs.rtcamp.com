**Note**: This feature works only with rtMedia PRO. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/).

Any image can be set as a profile picture in BuddyPress or WordPress, as shown below:

Use these steps to set an image as the profile picture:


  1. Click an image.

	
  2. On the individual page or lightbox that opens, click **Set as Profile Pic**.

  3. Without BuddyPress, the image is directly set as the profile picture in WordPress. If you are part of a BuddyPress community, the **Change Avatar** page opens to allow you to crop the image before using it. With the cropping tool, set the desired dimensions and shape and click **Crop Image**. This will set the cropped image as the profile picture.

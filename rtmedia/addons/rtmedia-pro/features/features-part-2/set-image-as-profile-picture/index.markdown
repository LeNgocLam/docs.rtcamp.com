_Note: This feature works with rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._

Any image can be set as a profile picture in BuddyPress or WordPress, as shown below:

Use these steps to set an image as the profile pic:



	
  1. Click on an image.

	
  2. On the individual page or lightbox that opens, click on **Set as Profile Pic**.

  3. Without BuddyPress, the image is directly set as the profile picture in WordPress. If you are part of a BuddyPress community, the Change Avatar page opens to allow you to crop the image before using it. With the cropping tool, set the desired dimensions/shape and click on **Crop Image**. This will set the cropped image as the profile picture.

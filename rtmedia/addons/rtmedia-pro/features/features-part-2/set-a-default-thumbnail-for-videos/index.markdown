With every video that you upload through [our audio/video encoding service](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/), several thumbnails may be generated. The highest quality thumbnail will be automatically chosen as the default one. You can change the default thumbnail by choosing one of the thumbnails generated.

To change the default video thumbnail:



	
  1. Click on the video to open it on its individual page or lightbox.

	
  2. Click the **Edit** button.

  3. On the Edit media page, choose one of the thumbnails generated as the default.

	
  4. Click on **Save**.

Note: The number of thumbnails depends on the relevant [setting saved by your site’s administrator](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/admin/rtmedia-settings/general/). If videos were uploaded before your site was upgraded to rtMedia core v3.1 or started using the [audio/video encoding service](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/), contact your site’s administrator to [regenerate video thumbnails](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/admin/regenerate-video-thumbnails/).

title: Reward Points
---

Users can attain reward points for activities such as creating albums, uploading media and more.

Using Reward Points on your site will encourage your users to become more active. We support  two plugins:



	
  1. [CubePoints](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cubepoints/)

	
  2. [myCRED](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mycred/)




The points for each action are [set by site administrators](http://docs.rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/rtmedia-pro/features/cubepoints-mycred-integration/).

The currently logged in user’s points and a leaderboard are shown in sidebar widgets on the site, as indicated in the screenshots below.

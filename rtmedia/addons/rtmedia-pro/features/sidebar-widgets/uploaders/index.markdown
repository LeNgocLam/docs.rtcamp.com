_Note: This feature works with rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._

To create a sidebar uploader:



	
  1. Go to **Appearance** > **Widgets**.

	
  2. Drag the** rtMedia Pro Sidebar Uploader Widget** from the **Available Widgets** panel and drop it in the desired sidebar area.

	
  3. Enter a title for the sidebar uploader.

	
  4. Select a context from the dropdown provided. This determines the WordPress, BuddyPress or bbPress context to associate uploaded media. If **Default** is chosen, media is associated with the current context. Read more: [Context in rtMedia](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/core-concepts/context/).

	
  5. Select a **context** **ID** to uniquely identify the context chosen in Step 4, to be associated with the uploaded media. To avoid confusion, make sure both Step 4 and 5 are either both set to Default, or specific values.

	
  6. Select an album where the media should be uploaded. The default album is **Let User Select**.

	
  7. Select the Privacy setting for uploaded media. The default is **Let User Select**. The other options are **Private**, **Users** and **Public**.

	
  8. Use the radio buttons to set **Redirect** to either **True** or **False**. If set to **True**, the page will be redirected to the uploaded media’s individual page. If **False**, no page redirection takes place.

	
  9. Click on **Save**.

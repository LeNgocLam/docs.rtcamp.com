title: Media Attributes
---

You can set as many attributes as you want for media such as Photo Category, Camera Type, and Location.

After adding attributes, you will need to add terms for that attribute. For example for the attribute *Camera*, terms can be *Digital*, *SLR*, and *DSLR*. You can also edit or delete attributes.

You may want either single or multiple terms for each attribute. For single term selection, set render type to **Dropdown**. For multiple selection, set render type to **Checkbox** while you are adding or editing any media attribute.

After that, click on `Configure` button to set `terms` for each attributes. `Terms` are like sub-items of single `attribute`. Like if you have a location as an attribute, then you can set terms as 'India', 'United States', etc. That way user can distinguish exact location where they have captured image.

title: Media Attributes
---

You can set as many attributes as you want for media such as Photo Category, Camera Type, and Location.

After adding attributes, you will need to add terms for that attribute. For example for the attribute *Camera*, terms can be *Digital*, *SLR*, and *DSLR*. You can also edit or delete attributes.

You may want either single or multiple terms for each attribute. For single term selection, set render type to **Dropdown**. For multiple selection, set render type to **Checkbox** while you are adding or editing any media attribute.

You can set as many attributes as you want for media like Photo Category, Camera Type, Location etc.

After adding attributes, you will need to add terms for that attribute. For example for the attribute Camera terms can be Digital, SLR, DSLR etc. You can also edit/delete attributes.

It might be possible that you want either single or multiple terms for each attribute. For single term selection set render type to “Dropdown” and for multiple selection set render type to “Checkbox” while you’re adding or editing any media attribute.

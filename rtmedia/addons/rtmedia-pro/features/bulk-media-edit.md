## Bulk Media Edit

While media files can be edited, deleted and moved individually, rtMedia PRO has added functionality that allows users to use **Bulk Media Edit**.

Click the **Options** icon and select **Bulk Edit**. This allows users to `Move`, `Delete`, and `Change Attributes` of multiple files that are selected.

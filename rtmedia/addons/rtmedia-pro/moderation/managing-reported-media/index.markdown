### Report button


A **Report** button is provided with each media or other item uploaded by users. The following screenshot shows how this button appears in a lightbox:

If you want to report some media to be sent for moderation, click **Report**. After clicking **Report**, the button changes to **Un-Report**. If you want to withdraw your report, click **Un-Report**. A user can also report media that he himself has uploaded.


### Moderation tools


Only the site administrator can access the moderation tools. After logging in as administrator to your WordPress website, open your **Dashboard**. Then, click **rtMedia** > **Settings** > **Moderation**.

Five options are available to the admin for each reported item. To access these options, point your cursor on the item you wish to moderate, as shown below:

* **View**: Allows the admin to view the reported item.
* **Email Uploader**: Emails the user who uploaded the reported item.
* **Allow**: Restores the reported item.
* **Delete**: Permanently discards the reported item.
* **Block User**: Blocks the reported item’s author from logging in to the website. If a blocked user tries to log into the website, the following message is displayed:

### Managing blocked users

A blocked user cannot log in to the website until the site administrator unblocks him/her. To manage blocked users, go to **rtMedia** > **Blocked Users**. All blocked users will be listed as shown below:

The admin has two options:

* **View**: Enables the admin to view the blocked user's profile.

* **Unblock**: Enables the blocked user to log into the website again.

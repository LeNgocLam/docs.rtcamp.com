### Report button


A **Report** button is provided with each media/other item uploaded by users. The screenshot below shows how this button appears in a lightbox:

If you want to report some media to be sent for moderation, click on **Report**. After clicking on **Report**, the button changes to **Un-Report**. If you want to withdraw your report, click on **Un-Report.  **A user  can also report media that he himself has uploaded.


### Moderation tools


Only the site administrator can access the moderation tools. After logging in as administrator to your WordPress website, open your **Dashboard**. Then, click on  **rtMedia** > **Settings** > **Moderation**.

5 options are available to the admin for each reported item. To access these options, point your cursor on the item you wish to moderate, as shown below:

**Email Uploader

**Allow**
Clicking on this option lets admins restore the reported item.

**Delete
** Clicking on this option permanently discards the reported item.

**Block User
**Clicking on this option blocks the reported item’s author from logging in to the website. If a blocked user tries to log into the website, the following message is displayed:

### Managing blocked users


A blocked user cannot log in to the website until the site administrator unblocks him. To manage blocked users, go to **rtMedia** > **Blocked Users**. All blocked users will be listed as shown below:

**Clicking on **Unblock **enables the blocked user to log into the website again.

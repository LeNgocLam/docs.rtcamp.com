The rtMedia Photo Tagging add-on does not require any settings or server configuration. Just **Install** and **Activate** the plugin in WordPress, and your BuddyPress members can easily tag them in uploaded photos.

## Troubleshooting





	
  * When tagging a photo, the auto suggested name of member does not appear in text box.

	
  * After clicking on auto suggested name, the member is not selected.


In both the above cases, there is a possibility that other WordPress plugins which you are using may be creating some issues with HTML, CSS or JavaScript Markup.


## Suggestion





	
  * Deactivate all the plugins one by one (except BuddyPress, rtMedia and photo tagging), and check which plugin is causing the issue.

	
  * Also, activate the default WordPress  theme and check whether photo tagging is working or not.

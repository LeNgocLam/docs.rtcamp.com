## Using rtMedia Kaltura Add-on


rtMedia allows only mp4 video files to be uploaded. rtMedia PRO allows the following video types to be uploaded: mp4, mov, m4v, m2v, avi, mpg, flv, wmv, mkv, webm, ogv, mxf, asf, vob, mts, qt, mpeg. Videos having file extensions other than these cannot be uploaded. rtMedia Kaltura Add-on removes this limitation in the following way:

1. When a user uploads a video file, the plugin will check if the file is in a compatible file format.

2. If the uploaded video file needs to be converted, the file will be sent to the Kaltura Server for conversion.

3. After conversion, the file will be fetched from the Kaltura server for display on your site. This means that although the file will be saved on Kaltura, it will be available for viewing in your website. In technical terms, this means that the video will be embedded on your site. See the [benefits of embedding videos ](http://www.robertsharpassociates.com/blog/embedding-video-website/)here.

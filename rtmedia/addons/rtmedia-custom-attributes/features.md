## rtMedia Media Attributes


Attribute is nothing but custom taxonomy which can be predefined by site owner. So that end users/members of site can use during media upload.

You can set as many attributes as you want for media such as Photo Category, Camera Type, and Location.

After adding attributes, you will need to add terms for that attribute. For example for the attribute *Camera*, terms can be *Digital*, *SLR*, and *DSLR*. You can also edit or delete attributes.


### Create, delete or edit attributes

By activating **Media Attributes** add-on. You can find `Attributes` tab under rtMedia section.

After that, click on `Configure` button to set `terms` for each attributes. `Terms` are like sub-items of single `attribute`. Like if you have a location as an attribute, then you can set terms as 'India', 'United States', etc. That way user can distinguish exact location where they have captured image.

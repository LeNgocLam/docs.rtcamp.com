## rtMedia Favorites


Users can create their list of favorite media (FavList) in which they can add media previously uploaded by any user.


To use this feature, the site admin first needs to enable the **FavList** feature from rtMedia admin settings.

A new tab - **FavList** - will be added, along with the other media types, as shown. Users can also set the privacy of FavList while creating one.

Group members can like images, audio and video. In order to like Media, access it via the Media Tab in your group. However, you cannot see which user liked which media.

As media **Like** is part of rtMedia free version, admin may wish to keep ON either Like or rating. However, it is not compulsory to do so.

### How it works
Site users can leave their feedback on media or other files in the form of star ratings:

1. Click on a media item or other file.
2. On the individual page or lightbox that opens, click at least one of five stars against the media item to rate it. You can change your rating by clicking on any of the stars again.

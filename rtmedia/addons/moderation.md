# Moderation


Note: This feature works with rtMedia PRO only. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/). Moderation enables the site administrator(s) to keep the site clean.

### Moderation


Enable moderation by turning **ON** this option.


### Remove Content After Reports


This option allows the site administrator to set the maximum number of reports after which the user reported content will be sent for moderation. If this field is set to **0**, the reported content will be immediately sent for moderation. In both cases, content that is sent for moderation cannot be viewed by anyone other than the site administrator(s).

### Admin Emails


This field is for the site administrator to enter his email address. If there is more than one site administrator, separate each email address with a comma.


### Email Notification Frequency


This option allows the site administrator(s) to set the frequency at which emails are sent when users report content to be sent for moderation. There are 3 options: **Daily**, **Hourly** and **Instant**.

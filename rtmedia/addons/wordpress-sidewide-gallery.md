## WordPress Sitewide Gallery (Albums)

Site admins and editors can create and uplaod media into WordPress album. You can create album without being dependent on BuddyPress.

### Enable WordPress Album Support

To enable WordPress album support, go to `rtMedia > Settings > WordPress` and switch on the *Enable sitewide gallery section* button. You can define permalink for album by putting slug (by default it is album) of your choice in *Slug for sitewide gallery section* which precedes by the album name.

### How it works
#### Creating An Album

After activating `enable sitewide gallery` section and putting desired WP album permalink slug, all the default WordPress roles would be seeing a new `Albums tab` except subscribers role.

#### All Albums and upload

In this section you can see all the published, drafted and pending albums.

To create new album, click the create tab, give a name to your album and publish it. After publishing you will see media uploader at the bottom, where you can upload the media. You can also edit previously uploaded media of that album.

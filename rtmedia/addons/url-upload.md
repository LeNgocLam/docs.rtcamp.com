## rtMedia Upload by URL

Users do not need to download media files from a URL and then upload it with rtMedia. Just provide the URL for the media and rtMedia will handle it.

### Enable URL Upload feature
To use this feature, the site admin first needs to enable the **URL Upload** option under **Other Settings** tab from rtMedia admin settings.

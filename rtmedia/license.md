**Important:** The license key is needed to receive automatic upgrades only. No features in any product gets blocked if you do not activate the license key.

The following are some common FAQs, followed by a troubleshooting guide.

You need to find the license key first in order to use it.

### Where Do I Find the Licence Key?

You can always find the license key in "my-accounts" section - URL: [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/)

Note that the above URL will ask for login details as it is accessible to registered users only.

If you do not remember the login details, do not panic. Reset your account password using the link - [https://rtcamp.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword](https://rtcamp.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword)

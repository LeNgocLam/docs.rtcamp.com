title: Upload Media
---

Uploaders for media may be provided in WordPress content areas through a [shortcode](/rtmedia/features/shortcodes/uploader-shortcode/) used by a site administrator.

With the [rtMedia PRO](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/) add-on running on the site, documents and other file types can also be uploaded, in addition to regular media.

Uploaders are a great way for site users to share media or other files, for instance, during a photography contest or while pooling in college reunion photographs.

After files are uploaded, they will be associated with a specific context in WordPress, as decided by the site administrator. They could be displayed with the help of an anywhere gallery, [as explained here](/rtmedia/addons/rtmedia-pro/features/anywhere-gallery/). This is how a typical uploader will appear on your site.

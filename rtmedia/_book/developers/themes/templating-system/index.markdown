**Note:** You may [try this quick-fix first](/rtmedia/developer/themes/templating-system/theme-media-tab/), which solved more than 90% of theme compatibility issues.


The templating system in rtMedia works in a standard way.


## Customizing Templates


To customize the templates, just copy the `/wp-content/plugins/rtmedia/templates/` or `/wp-content/plugins/buddypress-media/templates/` directory to your current theme's directory and rename it **rtmedia**.

If rtMedia finds the relevant template inside the `{your_theme}/rtmedia/` directory, it is loaded instead of the one included with the plugin.

After this, you can modify the template files to your need.


## Template Files

  * main.php


  * media/album-gallery.php


  * media/album-gallery-item.php


  * media/album-single-edit.php


  * media/media-gallery.php


  * media/media-gallery-item.php

    The main template responsible for the rtMedia template outputs

    This template is used to display lists of media, when using the shortcode, or on a BuddyPress component.

    Used to render each media item or album in a gallery view

uploader.php
    Used for displaying the _Anywhere_Â uploader using the shortcode, or on BuddyPress components



## Important Notes


As many features of rtMedia depend on Javascript, it is not advisable to change the markup a lot. It is also not advisable to remove any class or id definitions. At the most, additional classes should be added. Any additional data that needs to be displayed in any of the templates should be done using appropriate hooks and filters.

title: 'Sidebar widgets: Uploaders'

**Note**: This feature only works in rtMedia PRO. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/).

An uploader is available in the form of a sidebar widget, as highlighted in the screenshots below.

Website administrators may allow users to choose albums or privacy settings, based on which drop-down lists can be used.


### Uploading Media


To upload a media item (photo, audio or video):

  1. If the site administrator has provided an option to choose an album for your media, select one using the provided drop-down list.

	
  2. If the site administrator has allowed setting the visibility for media, use the drop-down list provided to choose from the options: **Private**, **Friends**, **Users**  and **Public**.

	
  3. Click **Select** to open a file dialog on your computer, and choose a media item.


The page then redirects to the uploaded media item’s page.

### Uploading Media Without Choosing Album or Privacy Settings


If your administrator has not allowed users to choose an album or the privacy settings, the sidebar uploader widget will look as follows:

The media that you upload will go to the album set by the administrator. Its visibility depends on the administrator’s choice.

  1. Turn moderation **ON** or **OFF**.

	
  2. Set the number of abuse reports after which content should be prevented from being viewed by ordinary users. Set this to **0** to send all content automatically for moderation, without users being able to view them.
 
  3. Enter the email addresses of Administrators in the **Admin Emails** text area, each separated by a comma. Emails will be sent to these admins whenever the **Report** button is clicked.

	
  4. Set the frequency of email notification to one of: **Daily**, **Hourly** or **Instant**.


## Managing Reported Media


Go to **rtMedia** > **Moderation** using the left navigation menu, to manage reported items.

The links highlighted in the above screenshot are used as follows:

  * **View** allows admins to view the reported item.

	
  * **Email Author** can be used to contact the reported item’s author.

	
  * **Allow** lets admins restore the reported item.

	
  * **Delete** permanently discards the reported item.

	
  * **Block User** blocks the reported item’s author from logging in.

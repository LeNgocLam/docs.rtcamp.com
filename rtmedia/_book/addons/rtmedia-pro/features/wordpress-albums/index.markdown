Site admins and editors can create and uplaod media into WordPress album. You can create album without being dependent on BuddyPress. 

## Enable WordPress Album Support

To enable WordPress album support, go to `rtMedia > Settings > WordPress Albums` and switch on the *Enable sitewide gallery section* button. You can define permalink for album by putting slug (by default it is album) of your choice in *Slug for sitewide gallery section* which precedes by the album name.

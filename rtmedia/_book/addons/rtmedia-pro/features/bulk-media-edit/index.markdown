title: Bulk Media Edit
---

While media files can be edited, deleted and moved individually, rtMedia PRO has added functionality that allows users to use **Bulk Media Edit**.

Click the **Options**Â icon and select **Bulk Edit**. This allows users to Move, Delete, and Change Attributes of multiple files that are selected.

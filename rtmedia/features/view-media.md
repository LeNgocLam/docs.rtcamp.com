## Viewing Media

### Viewing Album List

Click the *Media* tab of BuddyPress profile, and then click the *Albums* tab to view the **Album Gallery**.

The **Album Gallery** lists all the albums that you have created.

On another user's profile, the albums will be visible as per the privacy setting with which they were created:
- Friends (BuddyPress friends)
- Users (Logged in users)
- Public (includes non logged in user)

If you use BuddyPress groups, the same media or album functions will be available there as well.

## BuddyPress integration

rtMedia adds rich media capabilities to BuddyPress activity pages, profiles and groups. This is where the core power of rtMedia will be evident.

BuddyPress users will find a **Media** menu made available in the admin bar menu, as shown below:

### Media Tab in BuddyPress Profiles and Groups

A **Media** tab is added on BuddyPress profiles and groups.

In BuddyPress profiles, the URL of the media tab takes this form:

http://example.com/members/<membername>/media.

In BuddyPress groups, the URL of the media tab takes this form:

http://example.com/groups/<groupname>/media

The **All** tab displays thumbnails of all recently uploaded media or other items.

Media is classified under Albums, Photos, Videos and Music. If the [rtMedia PRO add-on](https://rtcamp.com/products/rtmedia-pro/) is running on the site, additional tabs of Playlists, Documents and Others will also be provided.

## rtMedia Albums


* Albums can organize your media. Since rtMedia 3.0, you can create albums _without needing BuddyPress_.
* A lightbox appears to present a slideshow of media items in an album.
* You can move media between albums and merge albums.
* Global albums can be used to define preset albums. **Wall Posts** is an example of global album.

* Albums can be disabled if you do not wish to use them from `rtMedia`->`Settings`.


## Viewing Album Gallery


Click the `Media` tab of your BuddyPress profile, and then click `Albums` tab to view the `Album Gallery`.

The **Album Gallery** lists all the albums that you have created.

On another user's profile, the albums will be visible as per the privacy setting with which they were created:

- public
- friends(BuddyPress friends)
- users(logged in users).

If you use BuddyPress groups, the same media/album functions will be available there as well.

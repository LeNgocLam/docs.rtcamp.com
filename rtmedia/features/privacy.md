##Privacy

rtMedia allows Admins to setup privacy for the end-user. Admins can do this by using `rtMedia > Settings > Privacy`.

Check [rtMedia Settings Documentation](../settings/settings.md)

If **User Override** is enabled by setting the switch to **ON**, a drop-down list appears so that users can choose who sees their uploaded media. (See the following screen shot).

User privacy preferences will override the default privacy setting made in the `rtMedia > Settings > Privacy`.

## Report Abuse

_Note: This feature works only in rtMedia Modaration. The plugin can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/products/rtmedia-moderation/)._

Media or other items can come with a **Report** button, if this feature is [enabled](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/admin/rtmedia-settings/moderation/) by a site administrator.

If you want to notify site administrators of abuse and take action:

1. Click the media or other item to open it in its individual page or lightbox.


2. Click **Report**, as indicated below:

If a pre-decided number of users report a particular item for abuse, the item is automatically prevented from being viewed by users and sent in for moderation. This number is set by a site admin.

To withdraw your report, click **Withdraw Report** for the reported media or other item:

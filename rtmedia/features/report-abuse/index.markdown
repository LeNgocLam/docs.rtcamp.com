If you want to notify site administrators of abuse and take action:



	
  1. Click the media or other item to open it in its individual page or lightbox.

If a pre-decided number of users report a particular item for abuse, the item is automatically prevented from being viewed by users and sent in for moderation. This number is set by a site admin.

To withdraw your report, click Â on **Un-Report** for the reported media or other item:

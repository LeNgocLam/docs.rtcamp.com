  * Albums can organize your media. Since rtMedia 3.0, you can create albums _without needing BuddyPress_.

	
  * A lightbox appears to present a slideshow of media items in an album.

	
  * You can move media between albums and merge albums.

	
  * Global albums can be used to define preset albums. "Wall Posts" is an example of global album.

rtMedia allows Admins to allow privacy for the end-user. Admins can do this by using rtMedia >> Settings >> Privacy

(Check **[rtMedia (Core) Settings Documentation](http://docs.rtcamp.com/rtmedia/getting-started/settings/#Privacy)**)

If **User Override** is enabled by setting the switch to **ON**, a drop-down list appears so that users can choose who sees their uploaded media. (See screenshot below).

![User privacy settings can override the rtMedia backend settings](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/UsersSettingPrivacyBuddyPressUpdates.png)

User privacy preferences will override the default privacy setting made in the **rtMedia** > **Settings** > **Privacy**.

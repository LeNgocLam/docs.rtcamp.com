The **Types** tab includes several settings to manage file types. _Note: Some of the file type settings work only in rtMedia PRO. rtMedia PRO can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._



	
1. **Media Type**: This column lists the types of media that users can upload on your site.

	
2. **Allow Upload**: By turning **ON** this option, you can allow users to upload specific types of media: photos, videos and music.

	
3. **Set Featured**: Turning **ON** this option allows users to use a media item as featured media. This depends on how the featured media template tag has been used. Read more: [Featured media template tag](/rtmedia/addons/rtmedia-pro/features/set-media-featured/).

	
4. **File Extensions**: This column lists the type of file extensions which can be uploaded by users for each media item. With [rtMedia PRO](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/), support is available for document and other file types also.

The **Types **tab includes several settings to manage file types. _Note: Some of the file type settings work in rtMedia PRO only. rtMedia PRO can be [purchased from our store](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/)._



	
  1. **Media Type**
This column lists the types of media that users can upload on your site.

	
  2. **Allow Upload**
By turning **ON** this option, you can allow users to upload specific types of media: photos, videos and music.

	
  3. **Set Featured**
Turning **ON** this option allows users to use a media item as featured media. This depends on how the featured media template tag has been used. Read more: [Featured media template tag](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/docs/admin/featured-media/).

	
  4. **File Extensions**
This column lists the type of file extensions which can be uploaded by users for each media item. With [rtMedia PRO](https://rtcamp.com/store/rtmedia-pro/), support is available for document and other file types also.

## Viewing Album Gallery


Click on the **Media** tab of your BuddyPress profile, and then click **Albums** tab to view the **Album Gallery**. The **Album Gallery** lists all the albums that you have created.Â On another user's profile, the albums will be visible as per the privacy setting with which they were created: **public**, **friends** (BuddyPress friends) or **users** (logged in users).

If you use BuddyPress groups, the same media/album functions will be available there as well.

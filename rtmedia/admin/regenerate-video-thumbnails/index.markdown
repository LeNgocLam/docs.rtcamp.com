title: Regenerate Video Thumbnails
---

Video thumbnails can be generated for videos uploaded through [rtMedia's Audio/Video encoding service](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/). The number of thumbnails to generate for each upload can be set from **rtMedia** > **Settings** > **General**. Refer to Point 5 on the [rtMedia's General settings documentation](/rtmedia/getting-started/settings/).

To regenerate a single video thumbnail from the media library (**Media** > **Library** > **Video** from the left navigation menu):

	
1. Hover mouse on video's name in the library.

	
2. Click **Regenerate Thumbnail**.

## Regenerate Pending Thumbnails


Thumbnails for videos can be regenerated if they were added before signing up for [the encoding service](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/). This action can also be done if videos were added before the site's rtMedia core was updated to v3.1.

Use these steps:
	
1. Go to **rtMedia** > **Regen. Thumbnails**.

## Troubleshooting


If you cannot find the thumbnail functionality or any of the links to help you regenerate thumbnails, follow these steps:

1. Go to **rtMedia** > **Addons**.

	
2. On the control area that appears, check to see if your API key is displayed.

  [![Have you entered your audio/video encoding API key?](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HaveYouEnteredAPIKey.png)](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HaveYouEnteredAPIKey.png)

	
3. If the API key is not shown, you will need to obtain one by signing up for [any of our plans, which includes a free 10GB-per-month-bandwidth plan](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/). To sign up for a plan, click **Try/Now** or **Subscribe** under a plan you choose from the **Audio/Video Encoding** tab under **rtMedia** > **Addons**.

	
4. The API key should be updated automatically. If for some reason the key is not updated, copy the API key emailed to you and paste it in the field **Enter API Key**.

	
5. Click **Submit**.

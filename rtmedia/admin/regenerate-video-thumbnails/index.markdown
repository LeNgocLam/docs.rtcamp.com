## Regenerate pending thumbnails


Thumbnails for videos can be regenerated if they were added before signing up for [the encoding service](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/). This action can also be done if videos were added before the site's rtMedia core was updated to v3.1.

Use these steps:



	
  1. Go to **rtMedia** > **Regen. Thumbnails**.

## Troubleshooting


If you cannot find the thumbnail functionality or any of the links to help you regenerate thumbnails, follow these steps:



	
  1. Go to **rtMedia** > **Addons**.

	
  2. On the control area that appears, check to see if your API key is displayed.
![Have you entered your audio/video encoding API key?](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/HaveYouEnteredAPIKey.png)

	
  3. If the API key is not shown, you will need to obtain one by signing up for [any of our plans, which includes a free 10GB-per-month-bandwidth plan](https://rtcamp.com/rtmedia/addons/audio-video-encoding-service/). To sign up for a plan, click** Try/Now** or **Subscribe** under a plan you choose from the **Audio/Video Encoding** tab under **rtMedia** > **Addons**.

	
  4. The API key should be updated automatically. If for some reason the key is not updated, copy the API key emailed to you and paste it in the field **Enter API Key**.

	
  5. Next, click on **Submit**.

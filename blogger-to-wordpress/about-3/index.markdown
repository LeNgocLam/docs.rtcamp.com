## About This Service


Blogger to WP (Wordpress) migration professional service is for bloggers who are looking to migrate their Blogger.com blog to self-hosted wordpress setup. We have started this portal, because we understand as a blogging platform, Wordpress offer better user experience, SEO advantage and community engagement. Most of the BlogSpot (Blogger.com) bloggers now understand the importance of Wordpress platform, but at the same time they are worried about losing ranking, search engine traffic, broken permalink, images and comments.

**In our Professional service, we provide:**




  * Wordpress installation and professional set up


  * Migrating from your BlogSpot (Blogger) blog to Wordpress hosted on your server


  * We perform migration in a way that you do not loose traffic, ranking and search engine juice


  * Wordpress and BlogSpot permalink structure are different. We maintain your permalinks using our own codes so that none of your link will be broken.


  * We also have in-house code to move your post images from Blogger.com servers to your own WordPress server.


  * We also make your new blog mobile friendly so that you can offer your readers an alternative way to read your blog.


  * Basic Wordpress SEO package to optimize your blog for search engine and drive more organic traffic


  * Making DNS changes for your custom domains (if you are using one)If you want, we can create a wordpress theme matching your Bloggers.com blogs' layout/template, so that when you move to wordpress your readers won't notice any change.

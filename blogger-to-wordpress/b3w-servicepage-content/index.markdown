## Key Features:





### #1. Maintaining Permalinks Structure


![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/maintain-permalink-150x150.jpg)Permalink simply means "permanent link". Its that unique link to each article on your blog which Google shows on search result pages, your visitors bookmark in their browsers, fellow bloggers use while linking to your posts from their blogs and so on!

With our custom codes and some manual work, we make sure that all permalinks on your blogs remain intact.

### #2. Search Engine Friendly Migration


![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/search-engine-friendly-150x150.jpg)For search engines, all that matters are permalinks. By maintaining permalinks, we already make sure that your maximum traffic remains unaffected from day one on WordPress.

Additionally, we install and configure the best SEO plugins on your WordPress as well as some of our own scripts to your server configuration. These boost your blog's ranking further in search engines.

### #3. Importing Posts, Comments & Images


![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/data-transfer-150x150.jpg)While WordPress imports all your posts and comments _most of the times_, there is no way to import images.

We have developed our own scripts to import images from Blogger.com servers to your own WordPress server.

Blogger.com can be used as free image hosting service, but why leave your images at Bloggers mercy!

### #4. Migrate Feed Subscribers


![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/feed-subscribers-150x150.jpg)It takes lots of hard work and time for a blog to build its reader base. Loosing subscribers can be the worst nightmare for any blogger.

No matter if you are using Blogger.com's atom.xml feed, FeedBurner service or any other way to _feed_ your subscribers, we have a perfect solution for each case.

### #5. Free WordPress Performance Optimization


![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/wordpress-performance-150x150.jpg)As you are on Blogger.com (as of now) you might be used to a very fast webserver with almost zero downtime.

Wordpress, at its core, is very optimized software but with wrong plugins and heavy traffic, your webserver may go down.

Here comes Wordpress performance optimization into picture.

### #2. A WordPress Theme Matching Blogger.com's Current Template


Do you ever feel annoyed when your favourite site like Facebook goes under redesign? If yes, it may happen that a random free WordPress theme which your visitors will see on your new WordPress setup may not go well with your visitors.

There are thousands of free WordPress themes all over the web but chances are less that you will find a free WordPress theme which looks like your Blogger.com template.

At a very affordable price, we can design a WordPress theme, which will look like your Blogger.com template. A step ahead, we will also move your sidebar widgets customization like Facebook fan-page code, newsletter box, adsense codes, etc to WordPress theme in most optimized way.

### #3. A New WordPress Theme With or Without Logo/Graphics Design


A completely opposite approach is to start with a redesign on WordPress. To start with a WordPress theme developed for your blog only.

A custom-made theme will have all Blogger.com customizations made for you but as its a new theme, it will not be restricted by Blogger.com templates look and feel. This new WordPress theme will have best of WordPress like related posts, tabbed navigation, dynamic menus, comment subscription and many more WordPress features integrated in it.

Either a Blogger.com lookalike or a custom WordPress theme - you better choose one rather than going for a random free theme.

### #4. Migration to High-Performance Nginx Server


Does your blog get more than a million hits per month? Do you hate it when your pages load slow and server goes down?

WordPress is a modern web-application. Traditional servers like Apache are no good when it comes to handling huge amounts of traffic.

There are many new-age webservers but we love nginx which powers the best Wordpress blogs and sites including WordPress.com.

If you are interested in running your WordPress on nginx, just let us know. We will setup nginx with all necessary configuration.

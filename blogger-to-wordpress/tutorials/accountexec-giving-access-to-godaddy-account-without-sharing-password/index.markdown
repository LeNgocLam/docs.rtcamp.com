Securing your server account details should always be a top priority. If you are using Godaddy's Domain/Hosting service and if you want to give access to other users to your account, you can easily do that using **Godaddy's AccountExec Service**.

**AccountExec** can be used to give access to other people to your account **without** giving them details about your username and password.

**AccountExec** gives you the power to  organize domains and delegate tasks as an **Executive**. It can maintain control and other services that the account owner has assigned to other users.


## **How to assign AccountExec **:





	
  * Go to Godaddy account : [Login](http://godaddy.com/)

	
  * Click on the _**Assign to AccountExec**_ option, from the left sidebar menu.

  * Enter all the information of the other user for whom you want to make an _**AccountExec.**_

	
  * Click on the **Invite** button.

The person receives an email invitation to become your _**AccountExec**_. This email contains the link to accept   the _**AccountExec**_ invitation. The _**AccountExec**_ should have a godaddy account or else will have to create one to accept the invitation.Once _**AccountExec**_ accepts the invitation, you can assign domain  names and other services for them to manage.

You can create a new folder for a particular domain that you want to assign to your _**AccountExec**_. Once you assign your AccountExec a folder to manage, all other folders are kept hidden, thus maintaining privacy.

**Note_:_** You can also use existing folders and share those as well.

  * Click on the _**New Folder**_ link.

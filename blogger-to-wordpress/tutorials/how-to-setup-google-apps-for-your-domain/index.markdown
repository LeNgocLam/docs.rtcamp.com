title: How To Setup Google Apps For your Domain
---

**Google Apps** is a service from Google for using custom domain name with  several Google products. It provides  similar functionality for your domain like email,  Calendar, Chat, Docs, Sites, etc. You can use free Google Apps service as well as the premium service (paid service) for the same.

By using **Google Apps** you can use email service for your own domain with the help of _**Google Apps mail  servers**_. For that you need to update  your domain MX records. To do that, you need to use your domain admin console to create **Mail Exchange** (MX) records that point to the **Google mail  servers**.


### Steps to Configure Google Apps :





	
  * Go to the following link in `[http://www.google.com/a/](http://www.google.com/a/)` (select the process for which you want Google Apps premium or free)

	
  * OR you can directly access by using this link [ `https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new`](https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new) (if you want premium service - replace '_domain'_ with '_premier'_ in URL) ;)

	
  * Enter the Domain name for which you want to use **Google Apps**.

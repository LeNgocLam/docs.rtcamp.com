title: Blogger vs WordPress – Non-Geekish Comparison
---

Considering that we offer a service for moving blogs from **Blogger (BlogSpot) **to **WordPress,** I thought of writing about some pros and cons about both.

We started our own journey from a BlogSpot blog which we moved to self-hosted WordPress [few years ago](http://devilsworkshop.org/bye-bye-blogger-devils-workshop-is-moving-to-wordpress/). Along the way, we grew as a [wordpress services' company](https://rtcamp.com/services/) and used the lessons we learned to move our clients' blogs from Blogger to WordPress. We came up with [this professional migration service](https://rtcamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/service/). Yes, we've offered Blogger to WordPress migration service for quite some time.

We do not think **BlogSpot **should be completely avoided, but compared to **WordPress (self-hosted), **it is not the best blogging platform around. Below are some reasons I found while comparing **Blogger **and** self-hosted** **WordPress**.

As this subject has been debated many times, I decided not to reinvent the wheel by getting into technical aspects. My goal while writing this, is to compare both platforms from an end-user's perspective, for someone who may never be interested in checking out code!


## New to blogging

It really depends on answer to one simple questions. The question is **"Why are you blogging?"**



	
  * If you are writing about your favorite things in life and basically creating a blog meant to be shared with family and friends, then using **Blogger **makes sense.

	
  * If you are new to blogging but interested in bringing your professional experience onto your blog, then a professional setup with a self-hosted **WordPress **would be a better idea.




## Simplicity in features

You want to spend more time in writing than actually tweaking your blog, in all probability. Right?



	
  * If you are using **Blogger**.**com **then the features are simple to use because there are few of them as compared to **WordPress**. **Blogger**.**com **is very easy to use. Good for someone to start-off blogging asap.

	
  * WordPress provides more options out of the box. This means, it may take slightly more time to take-off. I have been using **WordPress **for over a year and feel that simplicity is not the exclusive domain of **B****logSpot.** Once you start using **WordPress, **you will find its interface extremely simple.

## Investing in a blog


[![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/investment-blogger-to-wp1.png)](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/investment-blogger-to-wp1.png)If you are a student, then this one might be biggest issue for you. But if you really do some math and act bold, this small investment can lead to long-time returns for years to come!



	
  * **BlogSpot **is helpful when it comes to creating a blog which needs zero investment. The account is free and you can start using it to publish your content which is basically a by product of something you are an expert at. The fact creating a blogspot blog requires zero investment does make it attractive.

	
  * **WordPress **is a free platform since you can install the **WordPress **software free on your server that hosts your site. But the problem is you have to register a domain and buy space from some hosting service. This means to run a self-hosted WordPress blog you will need some initial investment. But it's not too much if you [see this calculation](http://bloggertowp.org/webhosts/hostgator). Of course, great things in life don't come for free.


On a personal note, if you are expecting returns from your blog, its better to invest something early. No top blog in this world is running _(read earning)_ with zero-investment! ;-)

## From Blog to a Business


[![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/blogging-business-blogger-to-wp1.png)](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/blogging-business-blogger-to-wp1.png)There are professionals like programmers, carpenters, writers and artists who have** **blogs. Their blogs may be initially an outlet for sharing information to them. But as your blog becomes famous, advertisers start purchasing ad-slots on your blog and if you are offering any service, you will see buyers lining up for your services. This is the time, when a blog takes that leap to become a business.



	
  * A **Blogger.com** blog is awesome when it comes to just writing content and getting it published on the Internet. But Blogger lacks many features and does not support deeper customization. A money-making business expects that from an underlying blogging platform.

	
  * **WordPress **has a plugin structure which makes it easy to add features on the go. Apart from that there is no limit to customization as code is running on _your_ server. This means you can provide a better experience to your buyer which is critical for the success of any business blog.

## Community and Support


[![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/community-blogger-to-wp1.png)](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/community-blogger-to-wp1.png)Okay now you have a blog which makes money, gets advertisers and you need advanced options. You know a bit about WordPress and Blogger and basically are looking to tweak your website.



	
  * **Blogger.com** has its share of gadgets and a community which does create custom solutions. But because of technical limitation of Blogger.com platform, no matter how much bucks you are willing to spend, a developer can actually do very limited stuff with for Blogger.com blog.

	
  * With **WordPress, **the community is massive and you will be overwhelmed by free support, theme & plugins you will find. And when free-world meets an end, you will find thousands of freelancers and companies competing together to offer every solution you need at reasonable price.




## Why move blogs from Blogger to WordPress?


All above points may help you when you are about to start a new blog. What if you have already started a blog on Blogger.com blog?

The journey of a** **blog from Blogger.com to a self hosted WordPress**,** is often representative of a blogger getting better at blogging. Its just like a sport. We play in the amateur or minor leagues in early days and then graduate to a professional major league team. Think of **Blogger **as a place where you learn the ropes of blogging and **WordPress **as the place to become a pro. ;-)

This is the key reason many people decide to migrate from Blogger to WordPress.

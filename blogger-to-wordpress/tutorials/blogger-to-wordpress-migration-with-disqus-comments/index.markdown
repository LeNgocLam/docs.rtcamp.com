[Disqus](http://disqus.com/) provides third-party commenting system for blogs running on WordPress, Blogger and other platforms. It's one of the comments moderation tool.


### Advantages of Using Disqus





	
  1. It is easy for your  reader to add comments into your post .

	
  2. You can directly add  comments by Twitter and Facebook account or by OpenID .

	
  3. Ease to share comments with Twitter and Facebook.

	
  4. Commentator's can fill out their name,  email, website (optionally)  and comment. But they can also login using  their Facebook or Twitter username. This not only show links to  their profiles, but also includes their respective profile gravatar.




### Problem- You can not import comments directly


Some bloggers prefers Disqus  for their Blogger.com blog. But when they migrated their blog from Blogger.com to WordPress they could not import comments directly as WordPress does not provide import tools for comments from Disqus account.


### Solution - Our Comment importer tool


Our team developed such a importer that import posts and comments from Blogger.com as well as all the comments related to their respective posts from Disqus account. This importer only require the Disqus account credentials  and once our tool get access,  it automatically creates relationship with posts and also on which date that comments were posted.
Check out the workflow of our Comment importer:

### Case Study - Project Pedal

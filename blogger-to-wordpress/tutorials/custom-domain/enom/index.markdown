title: Custom Domain Setup on Blogger with Enom
---

Custom domain setup in Blogger.com is used to create your own blog URL. (for example: fromÂ _myblog.blogspot.com_ to_ myblog.com_).

When you purchase a domain from Enom.com, they assign an IP address (A record and CNAME record) for the domain. Hence, you need to change those records to point to your Blogger.com blog.This post can help you to change the A and CNAME records of your Enom domain.


### Follow these steps to setup your Blogger domain with your Enom account:


1. Log in to your account at the [Enom Domain Services](https://access.enom.com/default.asp).

2. After logging in, the control panel appears, where you should look for the 'Host Records' section shown below.

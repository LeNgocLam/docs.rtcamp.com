When you create your free blog on **Blogger.com**, it gives you a default domain, which looks something like this  **myblog.blogspot.com**. It also provides you with the option of creating your own domain name, such as **myblog.com** or **myblog.org**.


## How to get your own domain name?


1. Log in to your Blogger account and go to the **Publishing** tab which can be found under the **Settings** tab.

2. Enter your desired domain name in the box and chose the extension (.com, .org, .net ) and check for its availability by clicking the **Check Availability** button.

3. If the domain name you provided is available, you can proceed further to the set up page.

4. If you have already purchased a domain, click on the **Switch to Advanced settings**, and enter your own domain name as shown in the screenshot below.

** Blogger.com** takes care of DNS setup and domain management as well, unlike other registrars such as [Godaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/), [I Love This Domain](http://www.ilovethisdomain.com/), where you'll have to configure DNS settings to point your blog to Blogger (Google.com) IP addresses.

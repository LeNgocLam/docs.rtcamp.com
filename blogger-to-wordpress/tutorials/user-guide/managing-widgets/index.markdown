## Introduction


**Widgets **are used to customize content that can be displayed on all the pages of the blog or website using **WordPress**. **Widgets** are often used for things like **RSS links **or just **categories**. Most times **Widgets **are used to display relevant things on the sidebar.


## How it works with Blogger!


**Widgets **are very useful when it comes to **WordPress **and they are very similar to Gadgets which can be added with **Blogger.com**. While using **Blogger.com** we might have used various **'Gadgets**' to add things like **Blog lists**, **pages**, **search box**, **followers**, **HTML/JavaScript**. It can be done by simply clicking on **Add a Gadget **link as shown in the image below.

## How it works with WordPress!


**Widgets** are very useful in **WordPress** themes, like **Blogger.com** has with the name **Gadgets.** In **Blogger.com** you might use it to add various things like "**blog  lists", "pages", "search box", "followers", "Text"**, some **HTML/JavaScript** by clicking on **Add a Gadget** link (_see the image_). Similarly instead of **gadgets **we have **Widgets **with **WordPress**.

**WordPress** provides us with some default **widgets** with the default theme. (At this moment **Twenty Ten** is the default theme with **WordPress 3.0** and onwards)


### How do we add and manage widgets in **WordPress**?





	
  * Click on **Widgets** option under **Appearance** menu.

  * You will enter in **Widgets** panel area where you can find many useful **widgets**.

	
  * When you install some **Themes **and **Plugins** you may get some extra **Widgets** related to that particular theme design. **Widgets** are very easy to handle. Just drag and drop  a **widget **wherever you want.

	
  * Mostly **widgets** are added in the sidebar of the **theme**.

## Summary


Just like **Blogger.****com **has gadgets, **WordPress **has **widgets**. They work in pretty much the same way and the difference is **WordPress** always has some default **widgets **activated. With **WordPress **some plugins when activated show up more **widgets** as active.

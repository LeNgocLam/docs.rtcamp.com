## Introduction


Many times when we start writing a blog we often like to share some **links** with our readers. For instance you might want to share **links** to other blogs you own or even display** links** to blogs run by your friends. **WordPress **allows us to create **Links Menu **and show them up on the website in a **Menu **for easy navigation.


## How it works with Blogger!


In **Blogger.com** you might be familiar with "**Blog List**", "**Link List**" and "**List**". These are gadgets that you need to add and they basically display** links** to other blogs or websites which are your favorite (_see image below)_.

## How it works with WordPress!


The same way you can add external **links** in your **Wordpress** blog. In **Wordpress** you can distinguish **links** by assigning **Link Categories**. This is very similar to how we assign categories to posts.



	
  * Click on **Links** **menu**, You will get three options **Links**, **Add New** and **Link Categories** (_see image below_).

  * Click on **Add New **we get started with adding links for the blog. **WordPress** by default provides a **Link Category** which is named "**Blogroll".**

	
  * The default **Blogroll** category cannot be deleted but we can rename it.

	
  * We can assign only **Link Categories** to **links** and not assign categories that were created for posts.

	
  * Click on **Link Categories **and we can add new categories. :-)

  * Click on **Add New** option and we get the area where you can add external links. Here we can add **Name**, **URL**, **Description** and assign **Categories** for the link.

For displaying these** links** in the blog with **WordPress** we need to use widgets or menus. Once you click on **Widgets** on the sidebar of the **Dashboard** we can drag and drop the **Link Widget** where we want the links to be displayed on the blog.


## Summary


Just like **Blogger.com** we can also show** links** to our favourite blogs with **WordPress**. This is possible on **Blogger.com** only by adding gadgets. With **WordPress **we can not only add **links** on the blog directly but also display them based on the categories.

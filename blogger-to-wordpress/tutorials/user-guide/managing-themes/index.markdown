## Introduction


Every website or blog for that matter has a separate layout and visual style. A theme presents all your readers with easy navigation which helps them explore your blog better.


## How it works with Blogger!


**Blogger**.**com** allows us to tweak, change and install different themes from **Design** **option** as show in the image below.

## How it works with WordPress!


**WordPress** also provides similar features add, activate, edit and delete **themes**.


### How to install new theme?





	
  * Click on **Themes** menu under **Appearance. **(_See image below_)

  * Now we can see all the** Themes** available in **Manage Themes **tab. These are **Themes** are already installed on your **WordPress** blog.

	
  * We can also look up free **themes** on **WordPress** by clicking on **Install** **Themes** tab. Here we get the option to search **themes** with various features which you find ideal for your blog template.

In case you already have purchased a **WordPress** **theme** for your blog. Obviously it's not available with the search options. In most cases you will have a **.zip** file containing the **Theme**. Simply click on **Upload** link and browse for the **.z****ip** file containing the new **theme** and click on **Install** **Now** button. :-)

### Video


Here is a video of how to go about installing a **theme** with the latest version of **WordPress**.


## Bonus Tips


We can also edit **theme** files from the **Editor** option but it is not desirable to use this editor and usually it is advised that a professional **HTML** and **PHP** editor is used. It is better to use [FTP](http://filezilla-project.org/).


## Summary


**WordPress** **themes** are usually more flexible than **Blogger**.**com**. This design flexibility is one of the main reasons for people to move from **Blogger**.**com** to **WordPress**. :-D

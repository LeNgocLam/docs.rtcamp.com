## Introduction




In a WordPress blog we can see there are a certain number of posts showed on the homepage along with date and time of publishing. These are some of the settings which are managed in WordPress with the **Settings menu **in the Dashboard.





## How it works with Blogger!


As you know that Blogger.com gives us **Settings** menu, under which we can find some options, shown in below screen shot :

With all these options we can **Import **and **Export **content, set the Blog **Title **and **Description**, format of the blog, handle the** comments **and **manage archives**, **email**, **Permissions**, etc.


## How it works with WordPress!


**WordPress** has also provided **Settings** option in **dashboard **panel on the left sidebar. All the options that **Blogger.com** has are also available in **WordPress**. Many of these settings you can find under **Settings** menu. (_See image below_)

### General Comparison of settings in Blogger.com and WordPress:


You might be aware of the Settings in Blogger.com and I thought a comparative feature by feature explanation would be useful.



	
  * In Blogger.com under **Basic** option you can add **Title** and **Description** of site, like the same way you find options under **Setting** -> **General** in **WordPress **and also option for site URL.

	
  * In Blogger.com** **under **Basic **option you had options like "**Search Engine**", "**Blog Listing**", etc. You can find it in WordPress under** Settings** -> **Privacy**.

	
  * In Blogger.com options like "Show at most" and "Time and Date Formating" are in **Formatting **option. The same options are found in WordPress under **Setting** -> **General** and **Setting** -> **Reading**.

	
  * In Blogger.com there is an option for **Comments**, but in WordPress all the options about comments you can find under **Setting** -> **Discussion**. We can also moderate comments under the option **Comments** (_below **Pages** menu_).

	
  * Blogger.com** **gives option **Site Feed** for "Allow Blog Feeds" and "Post Feed Redirect URL", but WordPress by default gives you feed URL, if you want to redirect your feed to your "**Feedburner**" URL then you can use [FeedBurner FeedSmith](http://wpgpl.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-feedsmith-wordpress-plugin/) plugin ( see [Managing Plugins in WordPress](http://bloggertowp.org/managing-plugins-in-wordpress)).

	
  * There are further settings in Blogger.com like importing and exporting blogs which can be covered under the **Tools** menu in WordPress. Do check out [All about Tools in WordPress](https://rtcamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/tutorials/user-guide/) for more details.




## Bonus tips


Plugins and certain themes when used give us some extra settings options which we can tweak. These options often show up under the **Settings Menu **on the left side bar of the **Dashboard**.


## Summary


When we use Blogger.com settings it has some limited scope regarding what can be customized. With WordPress there is a lot more flexibility regarding how we can tweak settings of the blog.

## Introduction


**Categories **and **Tags **are something that allow us to bunch together certain posts covering similar topics. For example you can choose to have **Google **as a **category **and apply it to every post which might be covering something about **Google**. **Tags **also pretty much do the same thing as **Categories**. Main difference is we can have **sub**-**categories **while tags have no **sub**-**tags**.


## How it works with Blogger!


In **Blogger.com **we use **Labels** and similarly with **Wordpress** we have **Categories** and **Tags** as explained in [**writing and editing a post on Wordpress**](http://bloggertowp.org/writing-and-editing-a-post-on-wordpress).

## How it works with WordPress!


**Categories** and **Tags** in **WordPress **play a vital role while writing posts. They are used for grouping of posts which are on similar topics.  Categories and Tags can be created even while writing a new post. To look that up check out [Writing and Editing a post on WordPress](http://bloggertowp.org/writing-and-editing-a-post-on-wordpress/).

### ****How to Create Categories on WordPress?****






  * Click on **Categories menu **as shown in above image. Now you should be at the **Add New Category** panel _(image below)_ and now we can start to creating new categories.


  * As you can see in the image below you can **Name the Category** and select a **Parent for the category**.




<blockquote>Example: We have a category called "Gmail" and Select a parent category as "Google" it means the 'Gmail' is a sub-category of 'Google'.</blockquote>






  * There are optional choices like writing a description for a Category and also for adding a name for slug. ****


**Note:** **WordPress** default category (**Uncategorized**) cannot be deleted but can only be renamed!

### ****How to Create Tags on WordPress?****


For creating tags the process is same as creating categories. The only real difference is that a tag cannot be assigned as parent. Which means we do not have sub-tags like we can create sub-categories.

In **Wordpress** there are usually many more **Tags** as compared to **Categories**. This is not a requirement and it is really up-to the end user.

Now lets see a video on how to go about adding and deleting **Categories** on **Wordpress**.


## Summary


Like we have **Labels **in **Blogger**.**com **we have **Tags **in **Wordpress**. The functionality for **Tags **and **Labels **are pretty much the same. **WordPress **has additional features like **Categories **which can also has sub-categories.

As of know you got the difference between **Blogger**.**com **and **WordPress**, that **Blogger**.**com **has **Labels **and in **WordPress **we can use **Categories **and **Tags**. :-)

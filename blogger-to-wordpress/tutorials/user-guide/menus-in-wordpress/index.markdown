## Introduction


On any website the key is to get visitors to navigate easily. This is done with the help of **Menus**. **Menus** are usually links to other parts of the website or even completely different sites which allow great navigation options for someone visiting a blog.


## How it works with Blogger!


In **Blogger**.**com **we can show **menus** with the help of **Gadgets**. This is done by editing the theme layout but showing **menus** in sidebar columns of the theme.

  * Now click on the **Save Menu** button.

	
  * You can also re-arrange your **menu** by simply drag and drop selected items like we do with widgets. :-) In case you are wondering about Widgets check out **[Managing widgets in WordPress](https://rtcamp.com/blogger-to-wordpress/tutorials/user-guide/managing-widgets/).**


Note : In a single created **menu** you can add **Pages**, **Categories** and **Custom Links**.


## **Bonus Tips**


You can also add **menu** in your sidebar. You just need to add **Custom Menu** widget. For details about **[Managing widgets in WordPress](http://bloggertowp.org/managing-widgets-in-wordpress/).**

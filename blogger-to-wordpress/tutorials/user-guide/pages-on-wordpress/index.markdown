## Introduction


**Blogs **have posts which but we do need to have some stand alone pages like **About Us **and **Contact Us. **Stand alone pages are great to point regular readers and let them know about some background information of the **blog**.


## How it works with Blogger!


In **Blogger.com** we need look up **Edit Pages** option under **Posting** menu for creating pages (_see image below_). Similarly we can create new pages with **WordPress**. Creating a post and creating new pages is very similar in **Blogger.com**.

## How it works with WordPress!





	
  * **WordPress** dashboard provides us with a separate menu for **Pages** _(see image below)_. Click on **Add New** option under **Pages Menu**.

  * Just like [we create content in a post](http://bloggertowp.org/writing-and-editing-a-post-on-wordpress/), we can also upload [images,videos and media in a page](http://bloggertowp.org/managing-media-files-with-wordpress/).

  * We can **Publish** a page or save it as a draft. Changing the date for publishing allows us to schedule the page to be published sometime in the future (See image below).

We can assign any parent page and also templates for page if the **WordPress** theme supports it. Pages are usually displayed alphabetically in navigation but you can change the order of pages by using the order field. These options are up to the end user's preferences.

  * We can also allow comments as well as "trackbacks and pingbacks" for pages. We can change **Author** of the page. Scroll down along the page and you will get two options **Discussion** and **Author** as seen in the image below.

### Video


Here is a short video which explains how to create a page on **Wordpress**


## Summary


Just like **Blogger.com** we can create and manage static pages on **WordPress**. In Blogger.com usually there is a restriction of creating only 10 static pages whereas with **WordPress** the options are literally unlimited. **WordPress** unlike **Blogger.com** can also be used for static portals instead on of only blogs. :-D

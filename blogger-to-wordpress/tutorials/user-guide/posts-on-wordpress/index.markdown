## Introduction


If you own a blog the most important part of running a blog is writing content. This content finally ends up being published as posts on a blog.

In this article we will briefly touch on how writing and editing is done on **Blogger**.**com **and explain in detail how we can go about it using **WordPress**.


## How it works with Blogger!


If you are used to writing posts on **Blogger.com** then you might recognize the image below. :-) Once we are at the **Blogger**.**com **dashboard we can easily start writing a new post by clicking on the **Posting **option.

## How it works with WordPress!


To start with, you can look at the image below for a quick idea on how to create new post with **WordPress**. The image below shows you two options to create a new post.

Now once you click on any of the two options, you will be at the **Add New Post** screen. This is pretty simple and has quite a few features which are similar to the **Blogger.com** layout for writing a post.


### **How to write a post on WordPress?**





	
  * The screen below shows you where you can add the title of your post and also the content that follows.

  * Now you might need to add videos and images or format the content further. If you do not see all the options to format the post content, do not panic. Just click as shown in the image below on the **Kitchen Sink** icon. :-)

  * Adding Images, videos and other files can be managed using Media Library. To know more about media check out [Managing Media with WordPress](http://bloggertowp.org/managing-media-files-with-wordpress/).



	
  * With **Blogger.com** you might be using **Labels **to organize or bunch together posts on similar topics. Similarly in **WordPress** we have [**Categories**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category) and [**Tags**](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Tag) instead of Labels. Check out [**All about Categories a** **nd Tags**](http://bloggertowp.org/all-about-categories-and-tags/).

### Allowing commentsÂ  and trackback ..


Once you write a post with **WordPress** you might want to link to other legacy blogs. To let those blogs know that you have linked to them enter their URL in the 'Send Trackbacks field'.

Below that you will see the **Discussion** box. By default both options are selected (see image below) and this allows people to leave **comments** on your post along with allowing other blogs to send **trackbacks** to the particular post.

### How to Publish your Posts?


Now that you are all done with writing your post you can go ahead and publish the post. If you want to **schedule** the post you just need to change the **date**. Alternately if you want to save your blog so that you can edit any time save the post as draft by clicking on** Save Draft**.

### Editing Permalinks


**WordPress** has a major advantage over **Blogger.com** when it comes to editing **Permalinks**. **Permalinks** are generated according to **WordPress slug**. The post while being edited allows the user to change the **permalink**. Even after the post is published you can change the **permalink** but that it not desirable from SEO perspective. It might end up with a **Page not found error** to other pages which have been linked to the post.

### Video


Here is a short video which explains how to write a post on **Wordpress**.


## Summary


There are many similarities with Blogger.com and **Wordpress **when it comes to writing a post. Some of them are editing in HTML, adding images and videos. There are some changes like adding **tags** and **categories** instead of using **labels** in Blogger.com.

The advantage you get while writing a post with **Wordpress **as compared to **Blogger.com **is that you can change the permalink of the post.

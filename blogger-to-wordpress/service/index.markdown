### #3. Importing Posts, Comments & Images


![](https://rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/data-transfer-150x150.jpg)While WordPress imports all your posts and comments _most of the times_, there is no way to import images.

We have developed our own codes to import images from Blogger.com servers to your own WordPress server.

Blogger.com can be used as free image hosting service, but why leave your images at Bloggers mercy!

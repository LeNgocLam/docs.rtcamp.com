#### Q 1. What will happen to images hosted/uploaded at Blogger.com? Is it possible to migrate all the images to Wordpress?


A. **Yes**. We have our own codes to migrate all images from your Blogger.com server to wordpress server seamlessly. Also we make sure that once all images gets uploaded on your wordpress server, all your posts imported from Blogger have image tags pointing to your wordpress server. If for some reason, you want to use Blogger.com as your image server, we can leave your images there!


#### Q 2. What about Posts and Comments? Will you be able to transfer all the Posts and Comments as it is?


A. The way we migrate your Blogspot blog, all your posts and comments will be migrated as it is. That means on Wordpress, your visitors can continue their discussion from where they left it on Blogger.com! :-)


#### Q 3. Wordpress permalink structure is different than Blogspot. Will it break my permalinks?


A. Wordpress' **default** permalink structure is different than Blogspot. But as wordpress is highly customizable, we change permalink structure in a way that none of your Blogger.com post links break once you migrate.


#### Q 4. What about my feed Subscribers? Will I lose them?


A. As [we are bloggers ourselves](http://rtblogs.com/blog-list/), we know importance of feed subscribers. So will make sure that you do not loose any feed subscriber in the process.

If you are using a service like FeedBurner we will give you a new feed URL. If you are using Blogger.com's default **atom.xml**, we will add some codes to your blog. In short, we will make sure that your old subscribers continue to receive updates without taking an extra effort!


#### Q 5. What about downtime? How much it will be?


A. Blogger blogs run in 3 different modes! Subdomain, Custom Domain & FTP. While we are capable of migrating all 3 kind of blogs to the wordpress, FTP blogs may face few minutes downtime. Rest will be migrated without any downtime!


#### Q 6. Do I need to share my Gmail/Blogger.com password to start the process ?

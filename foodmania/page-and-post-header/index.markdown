<p>Each page and post has a header where you can set your featured image and add some description about the page/post.</p>

<p>To enter the desciption, look for "Add Page Description" field below you wordpress post editor where you edit post or pages.</p>
<p><strong>Featured Image : </strong>Your post or page featured image will be used as background of post/page header. So upload featured images which are 1408x500px. The same image will be used on archive pages for listing your posts however different image dimension will automatically be fetched for it. If the featured image is less than 1408px in width they will stretch to cover the total width of the header.</p>

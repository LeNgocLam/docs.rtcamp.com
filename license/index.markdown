Absolutely no. Feel free to use our products on as many development/staging sites you need. Ignore license-key notification.

No features will be crippled in absence of license key.

If you wish to upgrade our products with any newer version on your development sites, you may do it manully by downloading new updates from "my-accounts" section at URL [https://rtcamp.com/my-account/](https://rtcamp.com/my-account/).


### What if I want to change domain name?


If you have already activated license on old domain, you can simply click deactivate button. Please check screenshot below taken from a wordpress-admin dashboard.

## Troubleshooting




### License key is not saved, when I click "Activate" button.


If you are not able to save license key for some reason, just deactivate the plugin/theme and activate them again.

Please give it a try 2-3 times.

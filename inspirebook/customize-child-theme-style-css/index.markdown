## Why Compact CSS?


In InspireBook we are using Grunt, Sass & Compass to make development faster. We are using compact version of style.css so the performance of website increases. Hence we provided Compact version.

As you know its always a good practice to not edit any file, hence we have given child theme for any customization work.


## Add Custom Styles


If you have activated child theme in your website, so you have two options. Either use InspireBook option, find it under `Dashboard -> Inspirebook -> Theme Settings -> Custom Codes` and there you can write the custom css. Or you can use child themeâ€™s style.css which we have already provided with child theme zip file.


## Expanded/Readable Style CSS


Since style.css given in InspireBook is not readable, We have provided expanded version of styles in theme itself. Please find the file name `style-expanded.css` in InspireBook theme folder.

Now with the help of expanded styles you can easily find that codes which you want to overwrite. Just copy that codes and modify it in your child theme.

EasyEngine is growing fast and so does requests for new features. But at the same time, we are having tough time finding good python developers. May be things will change once EE becomes profitable. 

Following things are planned. Not in order. Some of following may be delivered as premium offerings.

- Site migration command (move old FTP site to new EE site + move EE site from one server to another server)
- Backup and restore complete EE site. Backup should support remote storage. Restore should be possible on any EE server.
- Plugin manager. Something as easy as NPM. May be we can setup a pip based server to host EE plugins.
- Something for Amazon AWS. 
- Plenty of third-party intergations
- Premium support integrated into EE. So site admin can request help from EE command line with all debug info.
- `ee doctor` command inspired by `brew doctor`. Should report issues as well as workaround.
- Watchmen release - monit based monitoring of all sites
- Beautiful admin tools. A HTML page with some JS magic on :22222
- Bulk operations e.g. install a plugin on all WordPress sites
- Support for ghost, gitlab, discourse and other non-PHP projects
- Better debugging of WordPress sites. Log processing and mapping erros to plguins and themes.

# Language and Libraries
EasyEngine is developed in Python so its necessary to give some information to developers about python
and standards we are using for developement to make their coding efforts easier.

## Python Version

EasyEngine source code is fully developed in python 3.x version to avoid later refactoring.
We are aware that Python 3.x has slightly worse library support but this would make over in future as
many applications are getting ported in python 3.x.
Refer [this](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) if you are confused with Python2 or 3.

## Coding Format

We are following [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for coding EasyEngine.

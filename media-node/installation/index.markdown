We have developed a common installation for RedHat , CentOs , Debian and Ubuntu Linux Distro , you don't have to go anywhere for [Media Node](https://rtcamp.com/media-node/) Installation
You will need root or sudo-level access to your Linux VPS/Dedicated hosting.




For **Ubuntu , CentOS , RHEL and Debian**, just run following command:

    
     curl -sL https://raw.github.com/rtCamp/media-node/master/install.sh | sudo bash




## Updating from BuddyPress Media FFMPEG 1.3.2 or below


If you are updating BuddyPress Media FFMPEG from version 1.3.2 or below you will have to update media node on your servers too. That can be done simply by logging onto your server and executing the following command:

    
    curl -sL https://raw.github.com/rtCamp/media-node/master/setup/update.sh | sudo bash









**For Other Linux Users**



	
  * Please [install FFMPEG library](http://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki). Also [check this](http://ffmpeginstaller.com/).

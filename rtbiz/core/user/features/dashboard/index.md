#Dashboard

The rtBiz dashboard is a collection of useful widgets. You can find various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) along with reporting charts.

These widgets give you a generic overview of your rtBiz system and activities happening within.

It will show various chart distribution based on the attributes assigned to the contacts & their terms.

*NOTE:* Ideally, according to current implementation; whenever any attribute is mapped with Contact CPT, a chart report for that particular attribute will be added as a dashboard widget in rtBiz Dashboard.


rtBiz Dashboard looks similar to screenshot below

Products module is a unique feature in form of a taxonomy to link it with other custom post types that rtBiz offers.
This displays various products and services offered by an organization.



Many a times, we want to link our Custom Post Types with the products in our E-commerce Store such as WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.

This module takes all the existing products from either a WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads store and synchronize them with the terms of this special attribute taxonomy Products.

So that we can assign these products to any custom post types that are registered with this taxonomy.


All the contacts and companies can be assigned the Products that it/they are using.

This special taxonomy *Products* stays available globally to all custom post types so that its terms can be shared between them. New terms are not required to create every time you create a new connection.

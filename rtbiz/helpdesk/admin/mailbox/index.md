# Settings

### Settings Access

Following users have read and write access to Helpdesk settings:

1. WordPress administrator

2. Contacts who have admin role in Helpdesk

All the other roles do not have any access to settings.

**Note:**

The future version of Helpdesk will provide user level settings. This means the 'Settings' tab will be visible to users but only with the user settings options.

For example: There will be an option in 'Settings' for users to unsubscribe from all mails from Helpdesk.

### Settings Interface

The interface looks as in the screenshot below. Every settings tab is being covered in subsequent chapters.

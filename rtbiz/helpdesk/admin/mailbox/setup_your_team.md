###**2. Add all users from domain:**

You can use this option if you want to add all the WordPress users who have the similar domain name.

###**3. Add all WordPress users :**

Using this option you can import all the WordPress users into Staff, in a single click.

You can give roles to all these new staff members. The Helpdesk roles are somewhat similar to WordPress roles. (Refer 10. [Staff and Roles](http://docs.rtcamp.com/rtbiz/helpdesk/admin/staff_and_roles/index.html) for details)

* Admin - Can manage all tickets and Helpdesk settings.

* Editor - Can manage all the tickets. No access to settings.

* Author - Can manage only the tickets assigned to them. No access to settings.

# FAQ

The FAQ is a list of possible questions and their answers. These questions are kept into various categories.

## Tickets

#### What will happen if I delete the Helpdesk contact of a customer who has created a ticket?

The ticket will still be linked to the customer's WordPress user. However, if the WordPress user too is deleted, then the ticket will then not have any creator.

## Settings

#### One of my staff member is receiving adult content mails though I have already enabled the filter?

Probably the customer did not check the 'Adult content' box while creating the ticket.
Or you (admin) might not have checked the filter from the staff's his/her profile.

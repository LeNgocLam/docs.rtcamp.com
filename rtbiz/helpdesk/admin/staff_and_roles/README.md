# Staff and Roles

### Helpdesk Roles
The roles and access level for Helpdesk are similar to WordPress user roles.

1. Admin - somebody who has access to all the settings and has read and write backend access to all the tickets.

2. Editor - somebody who has read and write backend access to all the tickets including the posts of other users.

3. Author - somebody who can only manage tickets assigned to himself/herself.

4. No Role - no access to ticket backend but has read-only access to the web interface of the ticket.

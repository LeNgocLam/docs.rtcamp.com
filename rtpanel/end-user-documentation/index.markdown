##### Link to Author Archive page


Check this option to display a link to all the posts written by an author.


#####  Post Categories


A post category is a word used to define the subject of a post . You can assign more than one post category to a post, although it is advisable to not go overboard. The default category provided by WordPress is **Uncategorized**.

**Post Categories** is enabled by default and it is advisable that you keep it this way for two reasons: navigability and SEO optimization.


##### Post Tags


Tags are more or less the same as categories. The primary difference between the two is that categories are compulsory, while tags are optional. Click [here ](http://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories-vs-tags/)to know more about the difference between posts and categories.

Since tags are optional, **Post Tags **is not enabled by default. Enable this option to optimize your site's SEO and to use a [tag cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud).


##### Topic Tags


A feature of bbPress, topic tags are tags that are added to forum posts. If you add a new topic tag, it will replace the previous tag. To use multiple tags, separate each tag with a comma.

This option is enabled even if you do not enable it. This is how  topic tags show up in a group's forum:

![Topic Tags in a bbPress Forum](http://docs.rtcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Topic-Tags-in-a-bbPress-Forum.jpg)

You can choose to display all of these post meta attributes above your content or below your content. The star rating in the above image has been generated via the [Rating-Widget: Star Rating System](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rating-widget/) plugin.


#### 4. Pagination Settings

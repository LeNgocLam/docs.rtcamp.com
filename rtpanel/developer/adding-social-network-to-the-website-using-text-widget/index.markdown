Nowadays social media has become an integral part of marketing and promotions. Be its a corporate site or personal branding site, everyone needs that social connect; to build the loyal fans and followers for your content/offerings. Hence adding social networking links has become a necessity.

You can add social networking buttons to your site in many ways:



	
  * **Adding code to the text widget.**

	
  * **Adding plugins related to social networking.**




## Adding code to the text widget or in the code:


Most of the social networking portals such as Facebook, Twitter have a share or like button code. This code can be copy pasted in the text widget. For example, If you want to add like button in the widget area you can follow the below steps :


1. Go to the [Facebook Like Button generator](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/).




2. Enter URL of your Facebook page where visitors will like your page.




3. You can also change the setting such as changing the layout, adjusting the width, font etc.




4. Once you are done with the setting you need to click on 'Get Code' button.

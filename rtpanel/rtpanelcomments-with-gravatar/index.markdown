**Gravatar** is abbreviation for "Globally Recognized Avatar". The user creates account in [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) with an email id and upload an image associated with it. If user uses this email id to post a comment, the blogging software checks if this e-mail id has an associated image at Gravatar. If so, then the associated image will be shown along with the comments.

Based on same technique 'rtPanel:Comments with Gravatar' widgets will show the comments along with the gravatar (that is associated with provided email id while posting a comment.)

At admin dashboard 'rtPanel:Comments with Gravatar' widget have provided following options to customize the Gravator display:



	
  * **Title:** This option is to set title for recent comments.

	
  * **Show Gravatar:** This option is to show the gravatar along with the comments. Check the check-box to show the Gravatar.

	
  * **Gravatar Size:** This option is to set the gravatar size. You just have to select the size from the drop down list.

	
  * **Show Comments:** This option is to set number of recent comments that will be displayed at front end.

	
  * **Show Alternate Comments:** Check the check box if you want to display the recent comments randomly.

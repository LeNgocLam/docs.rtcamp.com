In this page we are going to discuss options/setting provided in `rtPanel > Post & Comments` tab.



## Post Summary Settings



This is a good feature in rtPanel, this meta box settings are reflected on Blog/Archive listing page. By 'Enable Summary' check box, it provides an option for 'Word Limit' and 'Read More' text. Also, user can set word limit for excerpt text and can change Read More text with required text.

## Post Thumbnail Settings



Again this option we used for Media present on Blog listing page. User can set thumbnail (Featured image) dimensions, after changing dimension you will need to run [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin. In 'Thumbnail Alignment' option, user can change image alignment, by default it shows in right hand side of post excerpt. Crop Thumbnail can crop image thumbnail in provided image dimension. Also, if wants to show the border around the thumbnail, can check 'Add Frame' check box.

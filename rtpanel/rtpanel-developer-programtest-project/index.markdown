The WordPress enthusiast across the globe are coming to join the rtPanel Developer Program. The developers are required to complete a test assignment before moving ahead.





### About Test assignment:




The test assignment will consist of a 'Theme Development' project. We will provide designs (fine layered PhotoShop files and sliced images) to the developer partners. Your work will be limited to WordPress theme development on rtPanel framework




Theme Development will be done on rtPanel theme framework as per the [standard guidelines](https://rtcamp.com/blog/rtpanel-developer-program-standards-guidelines/) defined by rtPanel team. Our QA team will do the testing and QA to ensure that the developed theme is bugs/error free. Our senior rtPanel Core developer team will do the 'Code Review' to suggest the required changes on codes. Your team shall do the suggested corrections to make the theme compatible with rtPanel development standards.




**Whats the incentive??**




You will get the credit for the development work done. The developed theme will be showcased on 'Theme Shwocase' section of rtPanel. It will give you tremendous visibility and you can showcase the theme in your portfolio as well.




The test project is a beginning of our long term association and its a first step for you to get paid WordPress projects from us.

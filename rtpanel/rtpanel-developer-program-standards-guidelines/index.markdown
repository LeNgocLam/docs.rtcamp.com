Quality of codes and usability of options are the key parameters we focus on, while developing the themes for clients. We do not just deliver the products but we add value to the offering by giving 'Life Time Free Bug Fixing Support'.

Its essential for developer partners to match with the rtPanel standards. Following are the standards rtPanel follows and insist fellow developers  as well to follow the same.



#### A. Use Child Theme:




While developing a new theme on rtPanel framework, you shall create a child theme. (Refer the sample rtPanel child theme [Download](https://rtcamp.com/rtpanel/download/) ) instead of customizing the core theme. You can use the [rtPanel Hooks Editor plugin](https://rtcamp.com/blog/rtpanel-hooks-editor/) to make the job easier





#### B. The Standards Guidelines:




Below mentioned guidelines and standards should be followed, while theme development






	
  1. Codex Standards: [http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines](http://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines)

	
  2. CSS Coding Standards: [http://codex.wordpress.org/CSS_Coding_Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/CSS_Coding_Standards)

	
  3. Theme Review Standards: [http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Review)




#### C. Functions Naming:




While writing any new function the naming should start with 'rtp_'. For example if the function is a slider the naming convention should be 'rtp_slider'.





#### D. Cross Check:




Once your child theme is ready as per above mentioned guidelines, you can cross check it for errors by  setting the 'WP_DEBUG', as true, in the wp-config.php file. (refer [http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Debug](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Debug)). It shall not give any errors, notice or warnings in theme.





#### E. Final Check List:




Our QA team will do the stringent testing of the child theme to ensure that it has no errors/bugs. You can follow our ['Check List'](https://rtcamp.com/blog/checklist-developers/) for final check.




Once done, you are ready to submit the theme, our senior developers will do the code review and will suggest you the improvements, if required.




If you have further questions, you can ask them at our support forum [here](https://rtcamp.com/support/forum/rtpanel/developer/).




Cheers.

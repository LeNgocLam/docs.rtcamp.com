<blockquote>**Many a times, we have been asked, why rtPanel do not have in-built SEO features?**</blockquote>


rtPanel has integrated with [WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/). We do not want to lock-in any user in our theme framework. So we deliberately avoid running into plugin territory. Yoast plugin being a matured plugin fulfills the SEO requirement of rtPanel. Further more the mark-up of rtPanel theme framework is also SEO friendly.


This plugin can be seen here in admin area Appearnce > rtPanel > General > 'Plugin Support' section.

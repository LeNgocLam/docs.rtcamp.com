rtSocial is a social sharing plugin which works on non-blocking java scripts. Unlike other social sharing plugins, it does not load the i-frames to display the data which makes it light weight and does not slow down the performance.

rtSocial offers Facebook and Twitter buttons with different styles, alignments and manual placements options.

Let us have a look at the plugin features:

**1. Placements:** The placement of social sharing buttons are important and it is based on the website design and layout. We have provided options to place the buttons as per your own desires like Top, Bottom and Manual placements of sharing buttons.

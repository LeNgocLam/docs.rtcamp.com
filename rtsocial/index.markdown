### How does it work?

  * Unlike other social sharing plugins, rtSocial does not use i-frames, instead it uses non-blocking JavaScript.

  * It uses a single sprite with all required images, hence eliminates the need to load images from the service providerâ€™s CDN.

  * It's compatible with all WordPress Themes.

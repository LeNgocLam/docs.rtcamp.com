title: Managing SSH-Keys
---

### Every user must add at least one public SSH key to his activeCollab profile before any git repos can be assigned to him. This restriction is from Gitolite. Admin can manage anybody's keys (add/remove).





	
  1. To manage keys, you can go to your activeCollab profile. You will see **"Public Keys"** section there.![](https://rtcamp.com/files/2012/10/Managing-Git-Keys-activeCollab-Gitolite-620x328.png)

	
  2. There you will see an option to **"Add New Key"** as well as **"Delete"** existing Keys.

	
  3. When you click **"Add New Key" **button, it will ask for a friendly key-name and value of the public-key itself. It also shows inline help so that you can easily create a new public key if you do not have one. It will be helpful for your team members who are new to git. ;-)![](https://rtcamp.com/files/2012/10/Add-New-Public-Key-for-activeCollab-Gitolite--620x204.png)

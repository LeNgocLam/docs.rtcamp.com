Project communication is critical part of knowledge library & knowledge transfer. Documenting every minute project critical information increases predictability and responsibility of over all process.

Tools used for communication within organisation:



	
  1. ActiveCollab

	
  2. Email

	
  3. Skype

	
  4. PIM

	
  5. Corridore talks, desk conversations, cafe talks


Tools to be used for documenting communication:

	
  * Ideally, ActiveCollab can be used professionally as a project management tool for recording vital data.

	
  *  Email may also be used, but the process will loose accountability.

	
  * Skype is the most commonly used option for communicating, but transcripts of the communication need to be saved on ActiveCollab

  1. Go to any activeCollab Project's **Source** tab. You will see a **"Add New Git Repository"** option there. ![](https://rtcamp.com/files/2012/10/Add-New-Git-Repository-on-Project-Source-Tab-620x140.png)

	
  2. When you click on it, you will get option to enter new repository name and access-levels for different users. If you don't see a user that most-likely means they do not have their public-keys added to their activeCollab profile.![](https://rtcamp.com/files/2012/10/Add-New-Git-Repository.png)

	
  3. When an user will go to the newly added repository, they will see some helpful instructions on How-to-use the new git repo. ![](https://rtcamp.com/files/2012/10/Newly-Created-Git-Repo-584x350.png)
